ralph,"Existing Home Sales Fall Slightly in April, Blame Inventory",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/existing-home-sales-april-17/,2017-05-24,"The share of inventory that sells has climbed to 25%; Though April’s existing home sales numbers fell back from March, the long-run story is looking good. Sales are now about 95% of their pre-recession peak, but this is down from 97% in March.
Though they’re nearly back to normal, existing sales have been slow to come back because of persistent low inventory, and April continues the trend. The number of homes on the market fell yet again, dropping another 8.7% from last year.
How are home sales trending up despite falling inventory? Simply put, homebuyers are gobbling up inventory at a much higher rate than in the past. The most recent numbers show that the share of inventory that sells has climbed to 25%. This is the largest share since 2005 and the third most on record.
Existing home sales fell 2.3% in April, but they’re still about 95% back to their pre-recession peak. This down from 97% in March. However, when adjusting for the fact that there are more households in the U.S., April’s numbers are about 85% back to normal, down from 87% last month.

Though they’re nearly back to normal, existing sales have been slow to come back because of persistent low inventory. The number of homes on the market fell yet again in April, dropping 8.7% year-over-year. How is it that home sales have grown strongly since the end of the recession while inventory has fallen? Simply, a higher share of homes on the market sell. In March (the latest available month for seasonally adjusted inventory), the share of inventory that sold climb to 25%. This is the highest since 2005 and the third most on record. Homebuyers, clearly stymied by low inventory, are gobbling up inventory at a much higher rate than in the past."
ralph,"New Home Sales Slip in April, Lag Historical Average",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-april-17/,2017-05-23,"April’s new home sales numbers fell back significantly from March. While concerning at face value, there isn’t much need for worry: new home completions also fell sharply in March, which means there were fewer new homes ready for sale.
Looking at the less volatile 12-month rolling total, new home sales look solid in April, growing year-over-year 13.7% year-over-year and inching up to 88.3% of the 50-year average.
How many new home sales do we need for the market to look normal? If we compare the share of new home sales to total sales, that share needs to more than double. In April, new home sales made up about 11.9% of all home sales, which is roughly half of the historical average of 23.6%.
New home sales in April fell to a seasonally adjusted rate of 569,000, which is down 11.4% month-over-month but up 0.5% year-over-year. However, April’s monthly numbers are just barely statistically significant (margin of error of 10.5%), so we should take them with a grain of salt. A less volatile number to look at is the 12-month rolling total, which is up 13.7% year-over-year. This represents the second most since July 2008. The increase over last year puts the 12-month total at 88.3% of the 50-year average.

However, the 12-month rolling total of new home sales compared to the 50-year average looks like there’s a lot more room to grow when taking into account the size of the U.S. population. New home sales per 1,000 U.S. households was 4.9 in January, which is only 67.8% back to normal.

How many new home sales do we need for the market to look normal? If we compare the share of new home sales to total sales, that share needs to more than double. In April, new home sales made up about 11.9% of all home sales, which is roughly half of the historical average of 23.6%. While it’s been tough for homebuyers to buoy existing home sales because of low inventory, it looks like there is much potential for new homes sales to run higher."
ralph,April Housing Starts Slip – Start of a Trend?,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/april-housing-starts-2017/,2017-05-16,"April’s new construction numbers dissapoint. All three of the major new construction indictors – permits, starts, and completions – fell from last month.
The silver lining for new homebuyers is that most of the construction pullback is in the multifamily sector, where economists have been expecting an eventual slowdown given the charge of multifamily units coming out of the recession. It looks that sharp pull back is finally here.
The one number to note is the pull back in single-family permits. We’ll be closely watching this closely in the coming months to see whether this is an anomaly or the start of a trend
New housing permits, starts and completions were all down over the month in April, dropping by 2.5%, 2.6%, and 8.6%, respectively, and fell to 66.3%, 60.1%, and 59.4% of their 50-year average.

The silver lining for new homebuyers is that most of the construction pullback is in the multifamily sector, where economists have been expecting an eventual slowdown given the charge of multifamily units coming out of the recession. It looks that the retreat is finally here. Multifamily starts and completions fell 9.2% and 19.8%, respectively over the month, and permits were flat.
The one number to note from this month’s release is the decline in single family permits, which fell 4.5% from last month. Permits are the longest lead indicator of new housing supply, so we’ll be paying close attention in the months ahead to determine whether this is a statistical blip or the start of a trend."
ralph,How the Trump Administration’s Tax Plan Might Impact Homebuying,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/trump-tax-proposal-may-17/,2017-05-16,"On April 26, the Trump Administration announced a new tax proposal that, among other things, would put many of the financial advantages of buying a home at risk.
While the proposal does not do away with the mortgage-interest tax deduction, it doubles the standard deduction and eliminates the ability of filers to deduct state and local taxes, including property taxes. While raising the standard deduction will undoubtedly put more dollars into the pockets of homeowners, it’s less clear how these changes affect the financial advantages of buying a home. We set out with our friends Prashant Gopal and Joe Light at Bloomberg to investigate who, where, and how these changes might affect the financial advantages of making the switch from renting to buying. You can read their story here.
We found that the tax plan’s biggest impact will be on:
Who: homebuyers making between $68,540 and $129,422 looking to buy homes priced between $358,000 and $676,000.
Where: Portland, Ore., has the largest share of for-sale home listings potentially affected, while Honolulu has the largest share of households.
How: The financial advantages of buying a home over renting would erode most in the broader New York metro area and in both major markets in Wisconsin.; Currently, there are tax benefits for buying a home if the annual mortgage interest paid is greater than the current standard deduction of $12,700. Under Trump’s proposed tax reform, this would increase to $24,000. While this means that many households will be able to write an extra $11,300 off their income, raising the standard deduction will also lead to a scenario where some homebuyers would no longer take the mortgage-interest tax deduction (MITD) because the standard deduction would be greater.
For these buyers, the financial advantage of making the switch from renting to homeownership would be reduced. As it turns out, buyers most likely to be affected are middle-income American households making between $68,540 and $129,422 who are looking to purchase a home between $358,000 and $676,000 and who take out a mortgage between $322,200 and $608,400.; Proposed Tax Reform Will Most Likely Affect Those Who:

*Assumes a 10% down payment.; The proposed tax reform will also push the benefits of the MITD further out of reach of the middle class. Under the current tax code, the top 43% of household earners can itemize their mortgage interest if they purchased a home. Under the proposed tax plan, that number would shrink to just the top 17%. Across the largest 100 metros, the share of households that would be able to take the MITD would fall most in Honolulu, moving from the top 55% of earners to the top 23% – a change of 32 percentage points. In the top 10 markets that would see the largest swings, more than 30 percentage-point fewer households would be able to take the deduction on a home purchase.; Percentile of Household Earners Affected by Plan

NOTE: Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, full data available here.; Nationally, 21.7% of for-sale home listings on the market during the week the Trump Administration announced the proposal were priced between affected range of $358,000 and $676,000. This suggests that homebuyers of over a fifth of homes currently for sale might not be able take the MITD if the tax proposal passes.
When looking at the share of households who can afford those homes between $358,000 and $676,000 based on their household incomes, the number increases to 26%. However, these shares of listings and households who might not benefit from the MITD varies considerably across the largest U.S. housing markets.; Markets with the Most Listings and Households Affected by Raising the Standard Deduction

NOTE: Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, full data available here.; For example, buyers of near or more than half of the homes currently on the market in places in Portland, Denver, and Sacramento, Calif., may not benefit from the MITD if the tax reform passes. In the top 10 markets, no less than 37.4% would be at risk, which includes metros such as Seattle, Boston, Dallas, Texas, and Washington.
When looking at the share of potential homebuyers who might be affected given the home price range they can afford, nearly a third would be at risk of losing the MITD when buying home. A full 31.9% of homebuyers in Honolulu would be at risk, while 30.7% 30.2%, 30.2% of buyers in Ventura County, Calif., Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Camden, NJ, would be affected, respectively.; We also found that the proposal could have a significant impact on Americans’ decision to rent or buy. To shed light on this, we modified our rent vs. buy analysis to look at how the financial benefits of homebuying might be affected across the 100 largest U.S. metros. We calculated the numbers for three different house prices in the affected range (the minimum price, $358,000, the midpoint, $517,000, and the maximum price of $676,000) and for two scenarios: one where buyers would be able to take the MITD and property tax deduction, and one without. We then examined the difference between the two for each metro to find out how much it might impact buyers of these homes.; How Raising the Standard Deduction Might Affect the Rent vs. Buy Decision: $358,000 Home

NOTE: Assuming 10% down payment, staying in home for seven years, and a mortgage rate of 4.2%. Negatives numbers indicate it is cheaper to buy than rent. A negative percentage means homeownership is cheaper than renting. In Madison, Wis., it’s 3.9% cheaper to buy a home than to rent under the current standard deduction. Under the proposed tax plan, it becomes 17.5% more expensive to buy than to rent a home.; At the lowest home price in the affected range, the proposed tax code changes swing our rent vs. buy metric from being cheaper to buy to becoming more expensive to buy a home in four markets: Madison, Wis., which moves from being 3.9% cheaper to 17.5% more expensive to buy; Salt Lake City, which moves from 14.9% cheaper to 2.5% more expensive; New Haven, Conn. moves from 17.1% cheaper to 0.8% more expensive; and Albuquerque, N.M., which swings from being 16.5% cheaper to 0.6% more expensive. What’s more, several markets make a swing from being a clear favorite for buying to being a wash with renting. For example, Austin, Detroit, Camden, N.J., and Chicago. move from being more than 20% cheaper to buy to being close enough to zero that homebuyers might be financially indifferent to homeownership.; How Raising the Standard Deduction Might Affect the Rent vs. Buy Decision: $517,000 Home

NOTE: Assuming 10% down payment, staying in home for seven years, and a mortgage rate of 4.2%. Negatives numbers indicate it is cheaper to buy than rent. A negative percentage means homeownership is cheaper than renting. In Newark, it’s 6% cheaper to buy a home than to rent under the current standard deduction. Under the proposed tax plan, it becomes 15.8% more expensive to buy than to rent a home.; Last, we see the biggest impact at the highest price threshold of $676,000. The proposed tax code swings our rent-vs.-buy metric to being more expensive to buy from being cheaper to buy in 20 markets, including all New York metro divisions (New York, Newark, and Long Island, N.Y.), both Boston metro divisions (Boston and Cambridge, Mass.,), as well as both of the major metros in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle and Portland). We also see the most drastic swings at this price point. For example, Newark would experience a 25.9-percentage point swing from being 8.8% more expensive to buy to 34.7% more expensive to buy, while New York makes a 23.2 percentage point swing from being 3.7% cheaper to 19.4% more expensive.; How Raising the Standard Deduction Might Affect the Rent vs. Buy Decision: $676,000 Home

A negative percentage means homeownership is cheaper than renting. In Newark, it’s 6% cheaper to buy a home than to rent under the current standard deduction. Under the proposed tax plan, it becomes 15.8% more expensive to buy than to rent a home.; Do these findings mean that the housing market will be worse off under the proposed tax reform? We think not for three reasons. First, the loss of the MITD would be made up for by the much larger increase in the standard deduction, leading to more money in a household’s pocket at the end of the year. Though, as we’ve shown, the tax benefits of homeownership will erode for some, it might help increase the ability of renters to save up for the all elusive down payment. In turn, this could boost home buying activity in the long run. The critical point is how households spend their extra tax savings. If households put these savings into the housing market, the impact of the proposed tax plan may be minimal on housing demand. If they don’t, demand in some markets may see significant cooling. Second, mortgage interest and property taxes are not the only deduction that itemizers take, and other deductions, such as medical expenses and charitable contributions, may push household itemizations to be greater than proposed standard deduction. In this case, buying a home might help households write off more than the standard deduction, and thus the financial incentives wouldn’t erode much. Last, these proposed tax reforms are just that: proposed. These reforms must make it through Congress, so none of these changes are guaranteed.; We derive our estimates of who would most be affected by the proposed plan by first calculating the mortgage balance, where the annual interest paid in the first year is between the current standard deduction ($12,600) and the proposed standard deduction ($24,000). We assume a 10% down payment and a 36% debt-to-income-ratio, and include property taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance to calculate mortgage approval. Those with taking out a mortgage between $324,000 and $603,000 fit the bill. Next, we calculated the income a borrower would need to qualify for these loans. For the lesser amount, a borrower would need an income of $68,923; for the larger, an income of $128,273. Assuming a 10% down payment, this would translate into a purchase price of between $360,000 and $670,000.
To identify markets that are most likely to be affected by the proposed tax plan, we calculated two metrics: (1) the proportion of for-sale single-family homes, condos, townhomes, and coop listings on Trulia between $340,000 and $630,000 in the largest 100 metros from April 23 to April 29, 2017 (the week the plan was announced), and (2) the share of households that make between $49,880 and $92,424 in the largest 100 metros from the 2015 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey adjusted to 2017 dollars.
Last, we calculate the financial benefits of homeownership for the 100 largest metros using our rent vs. buy methodology, which can be found here. We amended our normal assumptions and assumed a 10% down payment, and calculated the metric for three different house prices in the affected purchase range (the minimum price, $340,000, the midpoint, $485,000, and the maximum price of $630,000) and for two scenarios: one where buyers would be able to take the MITD and property tax deduction, and one without. We then examined the difference between the two for each metro to find out how much it might impact these homebuyers. We calculated the associated rents for each of those price points by taking the median rental value from Trulia’s rental estimates of homes priced within $20,000 of those three prices."
ralph,The Housing Recovery That Wasn’t,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/home-value-recovery-2017/,2017-05-03,"When it comes to the value of individual homes, the U.S. housing market has yet to recover. In fact, just 34.2% of homes nationally have seen their value surpass their pre-recession peak.
What’s more, the geography of the housing market recovery has been uneven. A full 98% of homes in places such as Denver and San Francisco have reached their pre-recession peaks, in comparison to fewer than 3% of homes in Las Vegas and Tucson, Ariz.
We studied property-level home value recovery nationally and in the 100 largest U.S. metro areas by comparing the nominal value of each home as of March 1, 2017 to the nominal peak value of that home prior to the onset of the Great Recession (Dec. 1, 2007). If the current value was greater than the pre-recession peak, we considered that home to have recovered.
We found that the majority of homes in the U.S. have not recovered to their pre-recession peak, but several markets have either fully recovered, or not recovered much at all.
Our findings include:
Nationally, just 34.2% of all homes have recovered to their pre-recession peak value.
Among the largest 100 metros, the share of homes that have recovered range from less than 3% in Las Vegas, Tucson and Fresno, Calif., to over 94% in Denver, San Francisco and Oklahoma City.
Markets with the strongest income growth between December 2009 and January 2017 – such as San Francisco, Seattle and San Jose, Calif., – have seen the largest share of homes pass their pre-recession peak values, while markets with the weakest income growth – such as Las Vegas, Daytona Beach, Fla., and Worcester, Mass. – largely remain below their peak values.; Though the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index and the FHFA House Price Index have exceeded their pre-recession peak, you’re more likely to encounter a home in the U.S. that hasn’t recovered than has. While these measures are indeed a sign that the housing market has improved since the Great Recession, they are aggregate measures. These aggregate measures use the average changes in sales prices of homes that sell, and thus don’t necessarily capture how the current value of individual homes compare to their pre-recession peaks. In fact, when we looked at the current values compared to pre-recession peaks, just 34.2% of homes have recovered their value. This paints a vastly different picture of the housing market recovery than both the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index and the FHFA House Price Index.; !function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script""),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement(""script"");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");; In addition, the 34.2% of homes that have recovered represent a post-recession high. In fact, after the recession ended in June 2009, the housing market continued reeling from the foreclosure crisis, sending the share of recovered homes to a low of just 7% in April 2012. Since then, the recovery has been slow and steady, climbing by about 5 to 6 percentage points each year. At this rate, we won’t see 100% of homes reach their pre-recession peak until approximately September 2025.; U.S. Metro

Other markets in the bottom 10 that were hit hard by the housing crisis include Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Bakersfield, Calif., Daytona Beach, Fla., and Riverside, Calif., and Rust Belt markets such as New Haven, Conn., Camden, NJ and Kenosha, Wis.; While the 100 largest metros include a good share of homes across the U.S., they don’t tell the full story of where homes have and haven’t recovered. To get a more complete picture of the home value recovery, we mapped the share of recovered homes at the ZIP-code level for ZIP codes with at least 50 homes. Interestingly, we found: most ZIP codes in the flyover states have seen at least half of their homes recover to their pre-recession peak, while fewer than half of homes in most ZIP codes along the coasts have not. Outside of major metros, the interior of the country has a higher share of recovered homes than coastal ones. Clearly, the idea that only coastal areas have recovered while the heartland wanes doesn’t hold when looking outside the largest metros.
NOTE: ZIP-code level, full data available here.; A natural question to ask: why have some markets seen strong value recovery while others haven’t? To find out, we compared the relative impact of four key factors that might be correlated with a market’s home value recovery: job growth, income growth, population growth and the post-recession vacancy rate.
It turns out that three of these four factors are significantly correlated with a metro’s share of recovered homes. A 1-point increase in income growth across metros is correlated with a 3.5-point increase in the share of homes that have recovered, while a 1-point increase in population growth and the vacancy rate is correlated with a 2.8-point increase and a 1.7-point decrease in the share of homes that have recovered, respectively. The intuition here is this: housing is what economists call a “normal good,” so when incomes rise, households tend to spend more on housing, which pushes up prices.
Population growth and vacancy rates also matter. This is because an expanding population puts upward pressure on the demand for homes, which pushes up prices. On the other hand, vacant homes act as excess supply, which tends to put downward pressure on prices all else equal.
Meanwhile, job growth isn’t correlated at all with home price recovery, but that’s not to say it doesn’t matter. The lack of significant correlation is likely for two reasons: (1) job growth by itself doesn’t necessarily mean that households can bid more for a house unless that growth is correlated with increasing incomes, and (2) if job growth is indeed correlated with income growth, we included a measure of income growth in our model that would capture the effect. See the methodology for detailed results of our analysis.; As we can see from the scatterplot above, most of the metros with high income growth also have a high share of homes that have recovered to their pre-recession peak. Many of these metros also had strong job and population growth. If we separate metros into income five equal groups based on income growth (quintiles), we do see large differences in the average rate of job growth between the group with the most income growth and the lower four. For example, average job growth among metros in the top group was 17.7% between 2009 and 2017, while average job growth was 13.5%, 11.1%, 10% and 9.3% in the bottom four, respectively. The takeaway here is that while job growth isn’t directly correlated with home value recovery, there is a direct relationship between job growth and income growth, the latter of which is strongly correlated with home value recovery.; !function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script""),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement(""script"");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");; In sum, the U.S. housing market recovery looks very different when examining the value of individual homes. Across the largest metropolitan areas, the recovery has been limited to a mix of economically booming metros in the West and metros in the South that were relatively unaffected by the housing market downturn. Outside of these metros, the recovery looks very different, as the majority of zip codes with at least half of homes recovered are limited to the U.S. heartland and the Pacific Northwest. Last, income growth seems to be primary differentiator when it comes to explaining why some metros are more recovered than others. Population growth and post-recession vacancy rates play a secondary role while job growth is likely affecting the recovery indirectly through its correlation with income.; We studied property-level home value recovery nationally and in the 100 largest markets by comparing the nominal value of each single-family home, townhouse, condo, or coop using Trulia’s property level home value estimates as of March 1, 2017 to the nominal peak value of that home prior to the onset of the Great Recession (Dec. 1, 2007). If the current value was greater than the pre-recession peak, we considered that home to have recovered, and aggregated to various geographies to calculate the share of homes that have recovered.
In our model of home value recovery at the metro level, we run a simple linear regression with the share of homes recovered regressed on four variables: the rate of post-recession job growth (from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, July 2009 – February 2017), income growth (from Moody’s analytics, July 2009 – December 2016), population growth (from the U.S. Census population estimates, July 2009 – July 2016), and the 2009Q3 residential vacancy rate (from Moody’s Analytics).

ralph,Owner Households Grow Faster than Renters for the First Time Since 2006,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/ownership-survey-april-17/,2017-04-27,"As homeownership shows recovery, Trump tax plan may disrupt trend; The Census Homeownership and Vacancy Survey (HVS) released Thursday shows that the U.S. homeownership rate increased over the year to an unadjusted rate of 63.6%, up slightly from 63.5% last year, but the change is not significant. While we can’t be sure whether the rate increased, decreased, or stayed the same, there is surprising news coming out of this quarter’s report. For the first time in nearly 11 years, the number of owner occupied households grew faster than renter households. The number of new owner households grew by over 850,000 in the first quarter of 2016, which is over double that of renter formation at just 365,000. Strong renter household formation is one of the resons why the homeownership rate has continued to drop since the onset of the housing crisis, so any sign this trend is reversing is something to take note of. We look forward to future releases of these data to determine whether this is a statistical blip or a trend.
 
How will the Trump Administration’s proposed tax reform affect the homeownership rate? On net, we expect the doubling of the standard tax deduction will actually put upward pressure on the homeownership rate. However, raising the deduction will help some households to buy while incentivizing others to rent. This is for two reasons. First, raising the standard deduction puts more money into the pockets of American households, which should help renters save for that elusive down payment, thus helping them become homeowners. This would put upward pressure on the homeownership rate. Second, raising the deduction will mean that some renters at the margins would not be able to write off enough mortgage interest from a home purchase to itemize their tax return, which lessens the financial benefits of making the transition to homeownership. This would put downward pressure on the homeownership rate. Given that young households, the majority of whom are renters, firmly feel that homeownership is part of their American Dream, and that the financial benefits of homeownership are large in most metros, we anticipate net effect of raising the standard deduction will help increase the homeownership in the long-run."
ralph,Housing Starts Boom in March,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-starts-march-17/,2017-04-18,"Housing starts were up in March, growing by 9.2%.; March’s housing starts numbers bring a mixed bag of news. Completions were up, which means homebuyers can again look forward to much needed new supply. On the other hand, starts were down, which means medium-run supply might dip in the second half of the year.
The real gem of March’s report was building permits, which boomed 17% year-over-year. Permits are important because they are the earliest signals of long-run new housing supply, so any significant movement is something to take note of. Homebuyers should rest assured that new home building will continue to relieve their supply constraint in the long-run.
Housing starts and completions were both up over the year in March, growing by 9.2% and 13.4%, respectively. That said, neither of these numbers are statistically significant. While good news on the whole, starts were down 6.8% over the month, which means medium-run supply might dip in the second half of the year. Both starts and completions have a long way to go before being back to normal, with starts falling to 62.3% and completions rising to 64.9% of their respective 50-year average.

ralph,"Population and Price Growth in Sunbelt Housing Markets, Census Says",Housing Policy,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/census-population-march-16/,2017-03-23,"The U.S Census on Thursday released its 2016 annual population estimates for counties and metropolitan areas. Taking a dive into the data, we’ve found a couple of interesting takeaways:
The Rust Belt continues to rust, while the Sun Belt continues to shine;
The correlation between population growth and home price is near a 30-year high.
The Rust Belt continues to rust, while the Sun Belt continues to shine
Let’s first take a look at the basics. The metros with the fastest and slowest population growth between 2015 and 2016 are roughly the same as metros with the fastest and slowest population growth between 1986 and 2016, and they are concentrated in Sun Belt and Rust Belt states, respectively. For example, each of the 10 metros with fastest one-year and 30-year increases in population are in just 10 states, nine of which are in the Sun Belt : Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington (non-Sun Belt).

Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas. Full data set can be downloaded here.; Population Growth Highly Correlated with Home Price Growth
How much is population growth potentially driving the housing market? Quite strongly. It turns out 2015-2016 population change across the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas is highly correlated with house price growth across the same 100 metros. This is good news since population growth is a fundamental economic determinant of housing demand. Across U.S. metros, population growth had a 69.5% (out of a possible 100%) positive correlation with house price growth, the second largest correlation over the past 30 years and second only to last year’s correlation of 76.1%. The 30-year average correlation is 25.2%. While there are undoubtedly other economic fundamentals that are also correlated with price growth, such as changes in income and land availabilitybetween population and house price growth does provide evidence that bubble-phobes need not worry that non-economic fundamentals are pushing prices higher. That said, the housing market does face one other fundamental headwind: low inventory."
ralph,Don’t Call It A Comeback: How Rising Home Values May Be Stifling Inventory,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/inventory-q117/,2017-03-22,"U.S. home inventory tumbled to a new low in the first quarter of 2017, falling for eight consecutive quarters. Homebuyers have now been stifled by low inventory for the last two years despite prices rising to pre-recession highs in many markets.; In this edition of Trulia’s Inventory and Price Watch, we examine how home value recovery may be limiting supply in markets that have recovered most. We find that homebuyers in markets with the biggest gains are facing the tightest supply.
The Trulia Inventory and Price Watch is an analysis of the supply and affordability of starter homes, trade-up homes, and premium homes currently on the market. Segmentation is important because home seekers need information not just about total inventory, but also about inventory in the price range they are interested in buying. For example, changes in total inventory or median affordability don’t provide first-time buyers useful information about what’s happening with the types of homes they’re likely to buy, which are predominantly starter homes.
Looking at the housing stock nationally and in the 100 largest U.S. metros from Q1 2012 to Q1 2017, we found:
Nationally, the number of starter and trade-up homes continues drop, falling 8.7% and 7.9% respectively, during the past year, while inventory of premium homes has fallen by just 1.7%;
The persistent and disproportional drop in starter and trade-up home inventory is pushing affordability further out of reach of homebuyers. Starter and trade-up homebuyers need to spend 2.9% and 1.6% more of their income than this time last year, whereas premium homebuyers only need to shell out 0.9% more of their income;
A strong recovery may be partly to blame for the large drop in inventory some markets have experienced over the past five years. On average, the more valuable a market’s housing is compared to pre-recession levels, the larger drop in inventory it is has seen.; Nationally, housing inventory dropped to its lowest level on record in 2017 Q1. The number of homes on the market dropped for the eighth consecutive quarter, falling 5.1% over the past year. In addition:
The number of starter homes on the market dropped by 8.7%, while the share of starter homes dropped from 26.1% to 25.9%. Starter homebuyers today will need to shell out 2.9% more of their income towards a home purchase than last year;
The number of trade-up homes on the market decreased by 7.9%, while the share of trade-up homes dropped from 23.9% to 23%. Trade-up homebuyers today will need to pay 1.6% more of their income for a home than last year;
The number of premium homes on the market decreased by 1.7%, while the share of premium homes increased from 50% to 51%. Premium homebuyers today will need to spend 0.6% more of their income for a home than last year.; 2017 Q1 National Inventory and Price Watch

Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas. Share is the percent of for-sale homes that fall into each segment, which is defined separately for each metro. Median price for each segment is the stock-weighted average of the median price of each segment in each metro. Some point change estimates may be slightly different than stated values because our differing procedure occurs before rounding. The full data set can be downloaded here.; In the first edition of our report, we provided a few reasons why inventory is low: (1) investors bought up much of the foreclosure home inventory during the financial crisis and turned them into rental units, (2) price spread – that is, when prices of homes in different segments of the housing market diverge from each other – makes it difficult for existing homeowners to tradeup to the next the segment, and (3) slow home value recovery was making it difficult for some homeowners to break even on their homes. While there is evidence that investors indeed converted owner-occupied homes into rentals as well as evidence from our first report that increasing price spread is correlated with decreases in inventory, little work has examined how home value recovery affects inventory. This is perhaps due to the tricky conceptual relationship between home values and inventory: too little recovery might make it difficult for homeowners to sell their home but cheap to buy one, while too much recovery might make it easy for them to sell but difficult to buy.; In fact, we find a negative correlation between how much a housing market has recovered and how much inventory has changed over the past five years. Using the current value of the housing market relative to the peak value as our measure of recovery, we find markets with greater home value recovery have experienced larger decreases in inventory over the past five years. The linear correlation was moderate (-0.36) and statistically significant. We also found that markets with the strongest recovery, on average, have experienced the largest decreases in inventory.
For example, the five-year average change in inventory of housing markets currently valued below their pre-recession peak (< 95% of peak value) isn’t that different from ones that have recovered to 95% – 105% of their peak. (-27.6% vs. -30.1%). However, the average change in inventory in well-recovered markets (> 105%) is 0more drastic at -45.4%.
The disparity also persists when looking at changes in inventory within each segment, although the difference is largest for starter homes. On average, markets with less than 95% recovery or 95% to 105% recovery had a 34.2% and 31.7% decrease in starter inventory, while markets with more than 105% home value recovery had a whopping 58.2% drop. These findings suggest that a moderate home value recovery doesn’t affect inventory much, but a strong recovery does and impacts inventory of starter homes the most.; Each quarter, Trulia’s Inventory Monitor provides three metrics: (1) the number and share of inventory that are starter homes, trade-up homes, and premium homes, (2) the change in share and number of these homes, and (3) the affordability of those homes for each type of buyer. For the first edition of this report, we back-calculate inventory for each quarter back to the first quarter of 2012 through the first quarter of 2016.
We define the price cutoffs of each segment based on home value estimates of the entire housing stock, not listing price. For example, we estimate the value of each single-family home and condo and divide these estimates into three groups: the lower third we classify and starter homes, the middle third as trade-up homes, and the upper third as premium homes. We then classify a listing as a starter home on the market if its listing price falls below the price cutoff between starter and trade-up homes. This is a subtle but important difference between our inventory report and others. This is because the mix of homes on the market can change over time, and can cause large swings in the price points used to define each segment. For example, if premium homes comprise a relatively large share of homes for sale, it can make the lower third of listings look they’ve become more expensive when in fact prices in the lower third of the housing stock are unchanged.
Our national metrics are a weighted sum of listings and weighted average of affordability of the 100 largest metropolitan areas and our inventory measure is an average of snapshots taken on the first of each month of the quarter. Last, we measure affordability as the share of income needed to purchase the median priced home in each segment relative metro household income terciles. To lessen the downward skew of income of households in the lowest tercile, we estimate starter homebuyer’s income using only household incomes of homeowners within this segment."
ralph,"Trump Housing Budget Would Hit Millennials, African-Americans and the Inner City Hardest",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/hud-cuts-trump-17/,2017-03-17,"On Wednesday, President Trump announced a new budget proposal and, as with any new budget, there are winners and losers. A proposed $6 billion cut – or 13% of the department’s overall budget – puts the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) into the latter. While these cuts will impact several of HUD’s programs, there are two standouts: the elimination of the Community Development Block Program (CDBG), and the $3 billion – or 8% – cut to the Section 8 rental assistant program. While it is difficult to know who directly benefits from CDBG funding, since they are used to fund a variety of projects from housing and infrastructure to economic development and property acquisition, there is a wealth of data from the U.S. Census Current Population Survey (CPS) on where and who benefits from Section 8 programs. We find that young, urban and African-American households would disproportionately feel the hit from a reduction in Section 8 rental assistance funding.
Who 
Using data from the 2016 CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement, we found that people under the age of 35 make up nearly 60% of voucher holders of Section 8 programs even though they are just 48% of the U.S. population.
When looking at race, about 49% of Section 8 voucher holders are white while 41% are African-American. Though nearly half of voucher holders are white, they make up about 75% of the U.S. population, which means they are underrepresented as voucher holders. On the other hand, African-Americans make up just 13% of the U.S. population, so they are vastly overrepresented as a share of those receiving federal rental assistance. This overrepresentation of African-Americans likely mirror broader socioeconomic disparities between whites and blacks, such as income, homeownership, and education.

Where 
Another interesting story emerges when we look at the geographic distribution of where Section 8 voucher holders live. Central city residents – what the  CPS-ASEC calls people who live in urban city centers – are overrepresented compared to their U.S. population. Of all voucher holders, about 44% live in central cities, but they only make up about 28% of the population. On the other hand, suburbanites are underrepresented. About 31% of voucher holders live in the suburbs but make up about 45% of the U.S. population. Finally, rural residents are about proportionally represented, making up 14% and 13% of voucher holders and proportion of the U.S. population, respectively."
ralph,"New Construction: Short Run Supply Looks Good, but Caution Warranted",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-construction-feb17/,2017-03-16,"Homebuyers should be pleased today’s new construction numbers, as both permits and completions were up in February. This means a healthy dose of new homes will be in the market this spring in an otherwise inventory-constrained market.
While the short run looks good for the housing pipeline, we should pay attention to the fact that permits were down in February. Permits are important because they are the earliest signals of new supply in the next 6-12 months, so any sign they are falling is something to take note of.
Both housing starts and completions in were up in February, growing by 3% and 5.4% year-over-year, respectively. That said, neither of these numbers are statistically significant. We can’t be sure whether the actual number of starts and completions in February was up, down, or flat. However, there is a long way to go before starts and completions are back to normal, with starts 63.8% and completions 56.4% of the 50-year average.

 
While the short run looks good for the housing pipeline, we should also pay attention to the fact that permits were down in February. Permits fell 6.2% month-over-month. While one month does not make a trend, any downward movement should be of concern since monthly permit figures tend to be statistically significant. Despite the downward blip, permits are the healthiest of these three indicators as they are no 69% back to normal."
ralph,How HUD Budget Cuts Could Hurt Housing,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/hud-cuts/,2017-03-09,"Without policy changes, HUD cuts may squeeze housing markets; A potential change to the federal government’s role in the housing market – specifically a 14% cut to the Department of Housing and Urban Development budget — could worsen housing shortages in major markets and dampen economic growth.
HUD administers programs that support the provision of affordable housing choice (Section 8, Section 202 and Section 811 Programs), facilitates growth of jobs and public services (Community Development Block Grant Program) and encourages redevelopment (Brownfields Economic Development Initiative) in communities where they’re needed most.
The budget cuts to these vital programs that the Trump administration is considering could undermine the housing market recovery in communities where affordable housing, economic opportunity, public services and community development is undersupplied by the private sector. Moreover, these budget cuts could put nearly 8 million Americans in both inner-city and suburban communities at risk of losing their public housing and nearly 4 million at risk of losing their rental subsidy.

HUD should reconsider the proposed $6 billion budget cut for these programs and pursue policies that would help the market help itself. For example, Trulia’s research shows:
New home construction in the U.S. is just 62% of historic norms;
Local delays in the building approval process and resistance to new development prevents much-needed housing from being built in markets where it’s needed most; and
Local resistance to affordable housing projects on the grounds that these projects reduce nearby property values is unfounded.
Further, cutting such programs could reverse the progress that has been made in reducing racial and housing choice segregation over the past five years. Last, we fear that such cuts could ultimately dampen economic growth by increasing housing stress for working-class Americans – teachers, firefighters, healthcare workers and more — who are vital for supporting higher-paying base industries in their respective markets."
ralph,Americans (Can’t Get No) Home Size Satisfaction,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/home-size-survey-march-16/,2017-03-01,"A majority of Americans sooner or later want a bigger – or smaller – home.; When it comes to their homes a majority of Americans are a lot like Goldilocks. They’re looking for a place that feels “just right” and in most cases want a home that’s a different size than the one they’re living in now.
That’s the main takeaway from an online survey conducted recently on behalf of Trulia by Harris Poll. We asked Americans about the space they live in and their ideal home size. What we found — even as U.S. home sizes continue to get big and bigger — was a lot of dissatisfaction.
The size of new homes built in the U.S. are now at record highs, with the average new home size sitting at over 2,700 square feet. In fact, new homes today are about 1,000 square feet – or 57% – larger than homes built about forty years ago. But is all this room satisfying American households? To find out, we surveyed a cross-section of over 2,000 Americans and asked them whether they would move into a bigger, smaller, or same sized home as the one they’re currently living in. As it turns out, bigger isn’t always better.; From the survey results, we found:
 
Most Americans aren’t satisfied with their current home size. Less than a third (32%) would choose a home the same size as the one they’re currently living in if they decided to move in a year.
Bigger homes are not always the key to satisfaction. Of those currently living in homes larger than 2,000 square feet, more would choose a smaller home than the one they’re living in than a larger one if they decide to move this year (60.6% vs. 39.4%).
Even after controlling for size of current home, age matters. Many more boomers (ages 55+) want to downsize than upsize (36% vs. 23%), and most millennials, ages 18 to 34, want to go big (46%).
 
Americans May Not Be Satisfied With the Size of Their Home, but Bigger Is Not Always Better
American households are living in a world of size mismatch – only 32% of respondents said they would want to move into the same size home as the one they are currently living in if they decided to move this year. That number drops to 29% of households when asked what they would need in 10 years. A full 14 percentage points more of households answered that the size of the home they would want to move into, in a year, would be larger (37%) than their current digs compared to the share that said it would be smaller (23%). However, that number went to zero when respondents were asked what size home they would need in 10 years – 31% for each.; But are bigger homes always better? Not so much. Trulia’s analysis of survey data found that of those who are living in the largest homes – defined as homes larger than 2,000 square feet – more would like to downsize than upsize if they had to move in a year. For those currently living in homes sized 2,001 – 2,600 square feet, more than 6% more Americans would move into a smaller home compared to a larger home (52.1% vs. 49.1%), and the share wanting to downsize as home sizes decrease. Of those currently living in homes sized 2,601 – 3,200 square feet, 35% more households would move into a smaller home than larger one (67.4% vs. 32.7%). For those living in the largest homes – over 3,200 square feet, 41% more households would like a smaller abode than a larger one (70.3% vs 29.7%).
What’s more, that differential increases substantially when Americans were asked what size home they would need in 10 years. For those living in homes sized 2,001 – 2,600 square feet, it jumps to over 33% from 6%; for those living in homes sized 2,601 – 3,200 it jumps to 38% from 35%; and those living in homes over 3,200 square feet it moves to over 56 % from 41%. Clearly, larger homes don’t always bring satisfaction to their occupants, our analysis of the Harris survey found.; Trulia’s analysis also found that the desire to go big declines with income, and the breakpoint of when more households prefer to downsize than upsize is around an annual household income of $150,000. For those making under $150,000, the desire to upsize is large with 65% saying they would move into a larger home if they had to move this year. On the other hand, 53% of those making over $150,000 would actually move into a smaller one.
 
Older Americans Want to Downsize, Younger Ones Want to Go Large
In general, young Americans want to upsize while older Americans are looking for smaller abodes if they decided to move this year. Those under the age of 56 would much prefer to move into larger homes than smaller ones if they decided to move this year. Thirty-three percent more millennials – aged 18 to 34 – would want to move into a larger home than what they’re currently living in than a smaller one (46% vs. 13%), while 47% and 18% more of those aged 35 to 44 and 45 to 54, respectively, would choose a larger home if they decided to move this year (57% vs. 10%; 38% vs. 20%). On the other hand, those over 55 are looking to downsize: 7% and 20% more of those aged 55 – 64 and over 65, respectively, would prefer a smaller abode rather than a larger one if they decided to move this year (28% vs. 35%; 18% vs. 38%). For the older folks, the difference is even more pronounced when asked what size home they would need in 10 years’ time. For those aged 55 to 64, the share who want to downsize jumps to 34% from 7%, and for those over 65, it jumps from 20% to 40%.; But wait a minute: aren’t older folks the ones living in larger homes, and thus, would be more likely to want to downsize? The answer is yes, but the sentiment still holds strongly even when we look across current home sizes in each group. More millennials, even ones living in homes larger than 2,000 square feet, would choose to move into a larger home if they decided to move in a year (86.3% vs. 13.7%). On the flip side, a majority of boomers (64.2%) – except those living in the smallest of homes (under 800 square feet) – would likely move into a smaller home if they decided to move this year. So even when controlling for the size of home one is currently living in, young Americans want to go big while older Americans want to go small.; Sizing it All Up
What does all of this say about home size preferences in the U.S.? For one, many Americans are living in a world of home size mismatch. Less than a third would likely move to the same size home than the one they’re currently living in, regardless of whether the move is in the short term (one year)(32%) or the long term (10 years)(29%). Second, larger homes don’t always quench a household’s thirst: those living in the largest homes in the U.S. are actually the most likely to want a smaller home if they decided to move in either the near or long term. Last, there are clear generational differences when it comes to preferences for home sizes, even when controlling for the current size of home households are living in. Millennials overwhelmingly prefer larger homes while their parents, boomers, want to downsize to smaller abodes. The key to satisfaction, it seems, may be a swap of homes between these two generations.
Methodology

While the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is an important metric to watch, it’s worth noting that the measure is more reflective of price movements in premium homes rather than middle or lower-tier homes.

ralph,New Home Sales Creeping Higher Amid High Demand,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-jan-17/,2017-02-24,"New homes are helping homebuyers constrained by low resale inventory, but there's room for more.; New homes sales in January were up 3.7%, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Monthly new homes sales numbers are highly volatile, and this month’s figures aren’t statistically significant.
However, looking past the monthly volatility, the 12-month rolling total of new homes sales are up 12.1% year-over-year and has boosted sales to 85.4% of the 50-year norm.
New homes are helping satisfy homebuyers constrained by low resale inventory, and the slow and steady uptick in sales reflects this. That said, new sales have much room to grow. In January, new home sales represented about 11.6% of all sales, which is less than half of the pre-recession average of 23.6%.
 
New home sales in January kicked off the year at a seasonally adjusted rate of 555,000, which is up 5.5% year-over-year and 3.7% month-over-month. However, January’s monthly numbers aren’t statistically significant, so we should take them with a grain of salt. A less volatile number to look at is the 12-month rolling total, which is up 12.1% year-over-year. This represents a resurgence of sales to a nine-year high. The increase over last year puts the 12-month total at 85.4% of the 50-year average, up from 0.4 percentage points from December.

However, the 12-month rolling total of new home sales compared to the 50-year average looks like there’s a lot more room to grow when taking into account the size of the U.S. population. New home sales per 1,000 U.S. households was 4.7 in January, which is only 65.4% back to normal but up from 65% in December.

How many new home sales do we need for the market to look normal? If we compare the share of new home sales to total sales, that share needs to more than double. In January, new home sales made up about 11.6% of all home sales, which is less than half of the historical average of 23.6%. While it’s been tough for homebuyers to buoy existing home sales because of low inventory, it looks like there is much potential for new homes sales to run higher."

ralph,Signs the Homeownership Rate May Improve,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/homeownership-rate-q416/,2017-01-31,"The homeownership rate stands near 40-year lows, but demographics suggest a shift is coming.; The Census Homeownership and Vacancy Survey (HVS) released Tuesday shows that the U.S. homeownership fell over the year to an unadjusted rate of 63.7%, down slightly from 63.8% last year. At face value, the continued drop in the homeownership rate isn’t necessarily cause for optimism in the housing market. After all, first-time homebuyers face significant challenges in today’s market: prices and rents are rising faster than incomes, inventory of starter homes hovers near post-recession lows, and student debt is making it difficult for young households to save up for a down payment. However, the devil is in the detail of the report, and there’s reason to be content with last quarter’s numbers. The continued growth in household formation is good for both the housing market and the general economy. Last quarter, we saw household formation tick up to 0.5% year-over-year, or 805,000 new households, but the increase was made up of more renter households rather than owner-occupied households. This effectively is why the homeownership rate has dropped: a greater share of new households since 2006 have been renters rather than home owners. But the margin is slimming: about 46% of new households over the past year were owner occupied.

That said, it’s not all rainbows and butterflies when it comes to consumer sentiment on homeownership. In Trulia’s end of the year survey, the share of Americans who say homeownership is part of their American Dream declined for the first time in five years. While the overall drop from 75% to 72% was modest, millennials soured on homeownership the most: in 2015, 80% considered homeownership as part of their American Dream, compared to 72% last year. Given millennials make up the largest pool of potential homebuyers in the U.S., this should be at least somewhat disconcerting. If the for-sale housing market is to continue building steam in the years ahead, this demographic will need to transition into homeownership in order to support the resale of homes by their older counterparts. Though home buying among millennials is likely to be volatile in the short-run, the long-run potential for this generation to support housing consumption in the U.S. is large.

Last, we think the Trump administration’s economic policies might actually push down the homeownership rate in the short-run. While President Trump called out the 50-year low homeownership rate during his campaign as reason to “bring back the American Dream”, we believe he faces gale-force demographic headwinds that will be tough to overcome with economic policy alone. Since young households aged 18 to 34 represent the largest living age group in the U.S. and nearly 40% are living with parents or relatives, any job-growth or tax-related policies that encourage this age group to form new households will likely push them into renting first as they emerge from their parents’ basements. In turn, this will likely push the homeownership rate down even further before they turn to homeownership in the long-run."
ralph,New Home Sales Surge to 9-Year High,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-dec-16/,2017-01-26,"New home sales in 2016 were the best in nine years, reflecting a combination of solid demand from homebuyers and new homebuilding that has reached post-recession highs.
While new home sales continued their steady climb in 2016, there remains room for growth. New home sales represented only about 10.4% of all home sales last year, which is well below the pre-recession average of 16.2%. Given the depths that existing home inventory has fallen, homebuyers could use much more relief from new home construction than what they’ve received thus far into the housing market recovery.
We expect 2017 to bring both headwinds and tailwinds for new home sales. Homebuyers are facing headwinds from higher mortgage rates and uncertainty about tax policy, low existing inventory, but near full employment, and rising wages are tailwinds that will continue to support new home sales in the year ahead.
New home sales in 2016 reached the highest level since 2007, bringing the annual total to 563,000 and growing 13.5% over 2015. While December capped off the best year in nearly a decade, new home sales as a share of all home sales is quite low. New home sales made up 10.4% of all sales in 2016, up from a low of 7.5% in 2011, but the share is still lower than the pre-recession average of 16.2%. Given the depths that existing home inventory has fallen, homebuyers could use much more relief from new home construction than what they’ve received thus far into the housing market recovery.

New home sales in 2016 were the best in nine years, reflecting a combination of solid demand from inventory-constrained homebuyers and new homebuilding that has reached post-recession highs. But what will 2017 bring for new home sales? We expect the upcoming year to bring both headwinds and tailwinds. While higher mortgage rates blow strongly into the face of homebuyers, low existing inventory, near full employment, and rising wages are strong tailwinds that will continue to push new home sales higher in the year ahead."
ralph,Is Flipping Flopping? Not in Sin City or Motown.,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/house-flipping-2017/,2017-01-25,"House flipping made a comeback in 2016, increasing for the first time in three years. On top of that, the share of home sales made up by flips last year was the most in a decade, and the third most since 2000. Las Vegas led the country in flipping activity for the second year straight, but house flippers in Detroit picked up their game more than flippers in any other market.
Looking at all the flips between Jan 1, 2016 and Dec 31, 2016, we found:
Nationally, home flipping has picked up for the first time in three years, increasing to 6.1% of all home sales in 2016 from 5.3% the year before.
Las Vegas tops the list with the most flipping activity in 2016, increasing to 10.5% in 2016 from 9.6% in 2015. This marks the second year straight that Sin City has led the country in house flipping. Of these flips, 11.6% had permitted work done to them, signaling that investors are adding value rather than speculating.
Detroit and Chicago saw the largest increase, jumping by 4.8 and 2.8 percentage points, respectively. In fact, both of these markets experienced peaks in flipping activity in 2016 – a telltale sign that investors are as active as they’ve ever been.
There are two reasons why house flipping trends matter. First, flipping is a speculative undertaking where investors are betting on turning a profit, and have historically occurred at high rates just before a market peaks. Second, flipping usually entails removing a home from a particular price point in the market and moving it to a higher price point through improvement. That movement creates competition for homebuyers who may be looking to build sweat-equity on their own, but it also provides improvements to the housing stock for buyers who don’t have time or cash to improve a home themselves.
Flipping Making a Comeback Across the USIn 2016, national flipping activity increased for the first time in three years. Flipped homes made up 6.1% of all home sales last year, up from 5.3% in 2015. This is the highest level we’ve seen since 2006 when flips were at 7.3%. Furthermore, flipping activity in 2016 was the third highest since 2000 and the jump between 2015 and 2016 was the second largest increase since that year.
Why is flipping activity picking up again? While it’s tough to single out one particular cause, rapidly rising home prices have likely played a major role. Home price gains in 2016 were the most since 2006, and prices in many markets are now back to their pre-recession peaks.
In general, flipping homes requires at least some growth in prices in order to entice investors to pick up their game. Even though they can add value by improving the quality of a home, rising prices provide a safety net when taking on a project. When prices are rising faster, investors flipping homes have greater opportunity to come out ahead even if the project doesn’t go according to plan. Over the past year, price gains have jumped to their highest level since 2006, and so has flipping activity.; Flipping Most Common in Las Vegas, Least Common in Wichita
Though flipping is picking up nationally, flipping activity varies significantly across individual markets. Las Vegas, Nev. leads the pack for the second straight year with 10.5% flips, up from 9.6% last year. At the top of the flipping charts, Las Vegas is followed by two Florida markets with Daytona Beach and Tampa having 9% and 8.4% flips, respectively. On the other end of the flipping spectrum, Wichita, Kan., Gary, Ind., and Louisville, Ky., have the lowest share of flips at 2% or less.; Housing Markets with Largest and Smallest Share of Flips

NOTE:To see the full data set, click here.; Not only did Las Vegas lead the country in flipping activity last year, it’s also getting close to its 2004 pre-recession peak of 12.4%. Does this mean the housing market in Las Vegas is going to flip out in the coming year? Maybe, but there are signs that investors there are actually making improvements to the homes they’re flipping.
But were Las Vegas flippers improving the homes they flipped or were they just speculating on price gains? To find out, we used permitting data provided by BuildZoom to calculate the share of flipped properties with city-approved building permits issued in the 12 months prior to the flip. While not all improvements on a property require a permit, such as painting, replacing light fixtures or adding window coverings etc., permit activity is a broad indicator of whether investors are improving properties or merely holding out for price gains. The good news is that 11.6% of flipped properties in Las Vegas had permit-approved work done on them. This is the highest since at least 2000. So although flipping activity is nearing record highs, so is the improvement on flipped homes.; Detroit Leads Markets with Largest Flipping GainsWhile Las Vegas leads the country in the share of home sales made up of flips, America’s heartland has seen the largest increase in flipping activity in the past two years. Of the 10 housing markets with the largest year-over-year increase in flips, seven are in the South and the other three in the Midwest. Surprisingly, Detroit, which has been the poster child for the dilapidated and abandoned properties left behind by the foreclosure crisis, leads the country in increased flipping activity with a 4.8 percentage points jump between 2015 and 2016.
Other markets where flipping activity has increased by two and three percentage points include Chicago, Knoxville, Tenn., Memphis, Tenn., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. In fact, many of these markets experienced record-highs in flipping activity in 2016 – a telltale sign that investors there are as active as they’ve ever been.; Housing Markets with Largest Increase in House Flippin

NOTE:To see the full data set, click here.; Last, flipping activity is still highly correlated with price gains across markets, but the relationship has fallen from previous years. The correlation between flipping and prices changes reached a peak of 0.60 (on a scale of -1 to 1 where either extreme means that the relationship is strongly correlated) a year after prices bottomed out in 2013. Since then, the correlation has dropped to a modest 0.25. During the bubbles years, the correlation consistently hovered between 0.5 and 0.6.; Is this a good thing? We can’t be sure, but we think so. As mentioned above, successful flipping can occur for two reasons: (1) investors add value to a home with deferred maintenance, which is a good thing, and/or (2) investors speculate that prices will rise and so they simply buy and sit on a home without doing any improvements, which is not so good. When the annual correlation between flipping activity and price change is as close to zero across metros as it is now, it’s much less likely that flippers are speculating on homes, and vice versa. Given the recent drop in correlation between flipping and price change, as well a steady increase in improvements in flipping hot spots like Las Vegas, there’s not much reason to flip out over the recent uptick in house flipping.; We differentiate between two different types of property flips: a traditional flip, which is the purchase of a house at market rate and selling it at a higher market rate price, because of improvement to the property and/or rising prices; and a clearance flip, which is the purchase of a distressed house at a discount because of a forced sale, such as a foreclosure, followed by a resale at market rate. We do not include clearance flips in our measure of flipping since our goal is to estimate the relationship between prices and flipping in a relatively normal, non-distressed housing market. As a result, our definition of a flip is a property that sold twice in a twelve-month period, in which both transactions are considered arm’s length.
To calculate the share of flipped properties in Las Vegas that had approved work done during the flip, we used city-level building permit records provided to us by BuildZoom and matched them with records all properties that were flipped in Las Vegas in a given year. We dropped all properties from our analysis that were built within two calendar years of the flip to ensure that approved permits were not related in any way to the initial construction of that property. Note that this calculation was only conducted for the City of Las Vegas rather than the Las Vegas-Paradise Metropolitan Statistical Area as also reported."
ralph,Housing starts in December made 2016 the best year since 2007,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/january-housing-starts-17/,2017-01-19,"“Housing starts increased in December, but much of the increase was due to a mild recovery from November’s large drop. Despite the modest bump, housing starts in 2016 were the best since 2007 and represents promising growth for the sector in 2017.”
“While starts increased modestly in December, they are only at 62% of their long-run average. Clearly, starts have much room to grow to meet historical norms.”
“While some of the challenges that homebuilders face are cyclical, stemming from an historically abhorrent fiscal recovery that started with the Great Recession, many of the challenges are also structural. Decades in the making, the latter originated from the sea change of strict land regulations that swept much of the country during the 1970s and 80s. So while there is much room for growth in starts as the economy continues to grow, the recovery in new construction will be slow and steady because of these structural challenges.”
Housing starts in December were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1,226,000, which is an increase of 5.7% year-over-year and 11.3% month-over-month. However, the increase in December was not enough to offset November’s large drop. Despite the modest bump, starts in new housing construction was at its highest since 2007. There’s also much room to grow from an historical perspective. When controlling for the number of households in the U.S., housing starts are still only 62% of its 50-year average, but this is up from 55% last month.

While some of the challenges that homebuilders face are cyclical, stemming from an historically abhorrent fiscal recovery that started with the Great Recession, many of the challenges are also structural. Decades in the making, the latter originated from the sea change of strict land regulations that swept much of the country during the 1970s and 80s. So while there is much room for growth in starts as the economy continues to grow, the recovery in new construction will be slow and steady because of these structural challenges."
ralph,"Housing Starts Drop in November, Fall to 55% of 50-Year Average",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/december-housing-starts-16/,2016-12-16,"Housing starts dropped in November, and the drop was more than due to more than October’s big increase. For context, housing starts in November were the second lowest since October of last year.
While starts fell in November, they continue to provide an important release valve for solid demand in the housing market, but still have much more room for growth. Starts in November were only 55% of their long-run average, but year-to-date they are up 4.8%.
We’re confident that housing starts will grow slow and steady through 2017 and beyond. Yesterday’s large jump in homebuilder sentiment is a good sign that they think so too. This will bring continued relief to homebuyers who have been stymied by a supply-constrained market over the past few years.
Housing starts in November were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1,090,000, which is a drop of 6.9% year-over-year and 18.7% month-over-month. Furthermore, the drop was more than due to October’s big increase. For context, housing starts in November were the second lowest since October 2015. That said, the historical view looks like there’s also more room for housing starts to grow. Controlling for the number of households in the U.S., housing starts are still only 55% of the 50-year average.

Though November’s drop is disappointing news for the housing market, we’re confident that housing starts will continue their slow and steady rise through 2017 and beyond. Yesterday’s large jump in homebuilder sentiment is a good sign that they think so too. More starts in 2017 will be welcome news for homebuyers who have been stymied by a supply-constrained market over the past few years."
ralph,"Housing in 2017: Discouraged Democrats, Revived Republicans, and Middling Millennials",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/american-dream-2017/,2016-12-07,"Americans’ Dream of Homeownership falls for the first time in five years, but Republicans are feeling new optimism about the housing market in 2017.; The outcome of the 2016 presidential election took many by surprise, and injected both optimism and pessimism into consumers’ expectations about the housing market in the year ahead. Republicans are feeling a surge of confidence about the housing market in 2017 while Democrats turned bearish, according to a research conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia,. Millennials also lost some enthusiasm when it comes to homeownership: fewer are saying that it is part of their American Dream, and most renters who are planning on buying a home are telling us they won’t do so until least the end of 2018.
As part of our annual look at the year ahead in housing, we commissioned two surveys of more than 2,000 Americans each about their housing hopes and fears in the year ahead. Rather than our single point-in-time look, we took a step further this year and deployed our annual survey twice, once before (Oct. 26-28) and once after (Nov. 15-17) the election, to find out if a presidential election affects consumers’ sentiments about the year ahead. We noticed some striking trends. Among them:
Republicans swung from being more pessimistic about the housing market before the election to more optimistic afterwards. Before the election, the percentage point difference between optimistic and pessimistic Republicans was -9 points when it came to buying a home next year. After the election, that changed to +17 points – a massive 26-point swing.
Democrats swung from being optimists about the housing market before the election to more pessimistic afterwards. Before the election, the percentage-point difference between optimistic and pessimistic Democrats was +13 points when it came to buying a home. After the election, that changed to -10 points – a drop of 23 points.
Millennials’ dream of homeownership has fallen more than any other age group, falling to 72% this year from 80% last year. Though 83% say they plan on buying a home someday, 72% say they won’t do so until at least the end of 2018.
In addition to the survey, we also put together a short list of predictions for 2017:
Rising mortgage rates will cool home buying in California and the Northeast, where our Rent vs. Buy margins are slimmest, but won’t have any noticeable impact in the rest of the country.
House price growth in the Bargain Belt will catch up with the Costly Coasts, especially because homebuyers there are feeling a renewed sense of optimism about the housing market.
Low inventory will bottom out and may even turn upwards, but homebuyers might not see price relief if President-Elect Trump’s policies boosts demand without boosting supply.
And finally, we’ve identified a list of 10 markets to watch in 2017 based on a healthy combination of affordability, job growth, and online search activity. Half of these markets are in the Florida, and so are the top three: Jacksonville, Cape Coral-Fort Myers, and Deltona-Daytona Beach.; How does a surprise presidential win affect the housing market? It’s too soon tell, but we do know that Republicans are feeling a renewed sense of confidence about all things housing in 2017. Democrats, on the other hand, are feeling down. When we conducted our first survey during the week of Oct. 24, Clinton was favored to win by a solid margin, and Republicans were pessimistic about the housing market in 2017. For each listed housing action in our question about the housing market in 2017, more Republicans thought 2017 would be worse than 2016. After fielding the survey during the week following President-Elect Trump’s win, Republicans had reversed course and were optimistic about the 2017 housing market for each listed housing action of our housing market questions. For example, Republicans went from having a -9 point margin[1] for buying a home in 2017 to a +17 point margin, a swing of +26 points, while shifting from a -5 point margin on selling a home to a +25 point margin, a swing of +30 points. Clearly, Republicans have moved from being bearish on the housing market before the election to outright bullish afterwards.
[1] Margin is the percent of respondents saying 2017 will be better than 2016 minus the percent saying worse.; On the other hand, Democrats have shifted from being bullish on the 2017 housing market to bearish. Before the election, more Democrats thought 2017 would be a better year than 2016 for each listed housing action in this question than thought it would be worse. They were most optimistic about selling a home in 2017 with a margin of +17 points. After running the survey in the week following the election, Democrats reversed course and became pessimistic on four out of five of our listed housing actions. For example, Democrats went from having a +13 point margin for buying a home in 2017 to a -10 point margin, a swing of -23 points, while sliding from a +9 point margin to a -11 point margin for getting a mortgage to buy a home, a swing of -20 points. In fact, immediately after the election Democrats were only optimistic about one housing market activity: selling a home, with just a margin of just +1 points.; Has the election affected Americans’ view of homeownership as part of their American Dream? Our interpretation at Trulia is that for most Americans, seemingly not. For the first time in five years, fewer Americans are telling us that homeownership is part of their American Dream, dropping to 72% this year from 75% last year, but the drop to 72% occurred before the election and remained so after. This suggests that the American Dream of homeownership hasn’t much been affected by President-Elect Donald Trump’s surprise victory, but perhaps they were muted by the uncertainty of an imminent change of the presidential administration.; While most Americans view of homeownership appear to have been unaffected by the election, millennials, on the other hand, have lost some of their warm and fuzzy feelings about owning a home. In November 2015, 80% of 18-34 year olds said homeownership was part of achieving their own personal American Dream. In October of this year, and just 10 days before the U.S. election, that number dropped to 76%. In the week after the election, it dropped again to 72%. However, millennials are a complex bunch. While their American Dream of homeownership fell for the first time in five years, 83% of them still plan on buying a home. Does this mean 2017 will be the year that millennials finally start to buy homes en masse? Probably not. Among millennials that currently plan on buying a home, 72% said they won’t do so until at least the end of 2018, so 2017 likely be a weak year for millennial home buying.
How will all of this affect the housing market in 2017? Based on these findings, as well as the extensive body of work we’ve rolled out this year, here’s what we expect in 2017:; Mortgage rates during the week of Nov. 28th hovered near 4%, rising nearly 50 basis points (0.5 percentage points) since the election. Will higher rates stifle homebuying in 2017? We think not. In October, we found that mortgage rates would have to more than double nationally in order for the cost of buying a home to be roughly the same as renting one. That means the recent rise in rates isn’t anywhere near eliminating the financial advantages of homeownership. In some markets, like Houston and Philadelphia, mortgage rates would have to be over 14%. However if rates rise to 5%, we do think there are a few markets where homebuyers might take notice. In places such as Honolulu and San Jose, Calif., mortgage rates would only need to be 5.3% and 5.4%, respectively, for the cost of buying to be the same as the cost of renting, so if rising rates would have any impact on homebuying, it’s likely to be in these markets.; What’s more, renters who wish to buy a home tell us they are more concerned about challenges in the housing market other than rising mortgage rates. In fact, rising mortgage rates places seventh among eight possible obstacles that potential buyers are saying is keeping them from buying a home. Just 18% of renters who wish to buy a home told us that rising mortgage rates are keeping them out of the market. Only the response “limited inventory” was lower at 8%. First on the list? The ever-elusive savings for a down payment. A full 59% of potential homebuyers tell us that saving for a down payment is their biggest obstacle to buying a home, followed by having poor credit (38%) and rising home prices (35%).; Last year, we expected housing markets along the Costly Coasts – namely, expensive metros in the West and Northeast– to slow, and markets in the Bargain Belt – the highly affordable housing markets in the Midwest and South – to pick up. In many cases, this has played out. For example, price growth has nearly halved in places like San Francisco (10% last year to 5.7% in September) and New York (3.2% last year to 1.8% in September), while year-over-year price growth has picked up in places like Minneapolis (3.5% last year to 5.3% in September) and Charlotte, N.C., (4.2% last year to 6.2% in September). Next year, we expect the Bargain Belt to continue catching up with the Costly Coasts for one primary reason: Bargain Belt metros are full of revived Republicans, especially in the South, while the Costly Coasts are full of discouraged Democrats. As we’ve shown above, Republicans have experienced a massive upward swing in optimism about buying and selling a home in 2017, so we think metros with the largest share of them are poised for housing market growth next year. In fact two of them, Jacksonville, Fla., and Cape Coral, Fla., rank among our top 10 metros to watch for 2017.

For example, each of the 10 metros with the largest share of votes for President-Elect Trump were in either the South (nine metros) or Midwest (one metro), while all but three of the 10 metros were in the West or Northeast (El Paso, Texas, Washington, D.C., and Madison, Wis.,). Does this mean Republican metros will suddenly boom and Democrat metros wane in 2017? Probably not, especially since job growth has been lower in red sttes, but if Republican enthusiasm and Democrat despair does lead to noticeable changes in housing market activity, we think they’ll help close regional differences in house price appreciation because of the stark geographic divide in where Republicans and Democrats actually live.; In our Fall Inventory and Price Watch, we found that although inventory fell to lows not seen since 2013 and there were signs that inventory was trending upwards in several markets, including supply constrained markets in the San Francisco Bay Area and Miami. As homebuilders continue to ramp up supply and rising prices and incomes help existing homeowners tradeup, we expect inventory to pick up in 2017. But as supply increases will house prices moderate? Maybe. While an uptick in inventory should theoretically help ease price growth, supply is only half of the story. If there is an equal or greater growth in demand, the pace of price appreciation could pick up again.
What might boost demand? A combination of a healthy economy and new policies under President-Elect Trump. In 2016, we’ve seen the unemployment rate fall to post-recession lows, income growth reaching post-recession highs, and household formation pick up. All three set the stage for increased demand for homes in 2017. Furthermore, President-Elect Trump has hinted at Dodd-Frank reform, which could eventually loosen credit and make it easier for homebuyers to borrow. This would also help boost demand. And because supply typically lags demand, we may see new demand translate into higher prices and reduced affordability. However, the new administration may also offer tax breaks to homebuilders in the hopes of boosting new supply, which could help satisfy new demand arising from financial regulation reform.; Looking for markets to keep an eye on in 2017? Look to the Sunshine State. Five of the 10 markets we think are poised for growth are there, with the rest in the Midwest, South, or Southwest. These markets exhibit strength in five key metrics: strong job growth over the past year, low vacancy rates, high affordability, more inbound home searches than outbound, and, because of the surprise election outcome, a large share of Republicans. They are:
 
Jacksonville, FL
Cape Coral – Fort Myers, FL
Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach, FL
Grand Rapids, MI
Tampa-St. Petersburg, FL
Colorado Springs, CO
Charleston, SC
San Antonio, TX
Phoenix, AZ
North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, FL
 
Jacksonville, Fla., tops our list because it has a very high inbound-to-outbound home search ratio and has strong job growth (ranked 6th nationally in both categories). Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL, ranks second because it has even higher job growth and a sharp drop in vacancy rates over the past year (ranked 4th nationally in each), but falters in affordability (tied for 73rd). Deltona-Daytona Beach –Ormond Beach, FL, ranks third on our list because of its strength in two categories: it has a very high inbound-to-outbound home search ratio and has strong job growth (ranks 3rd in both categories), but like Cape Coral – Fort Myers, FL, lags in affordability. Note that markets in the costly West or Northeast fail to make our list, primarily because of low affordability (mostly in the West) and slower job growth (mostly in the Northeast).; The 2016 surveys were conducted online within the United States between Oct. 26th and 28th among 2,007 adults (aged 18 and older) and again on Nov. 15th and 17th, 2016 among 2,081 adults (aged 18 and over) by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia via its Quick Query omnibus product. The 2015 survey was conducted online within the United States between November 19th and 23rd, 2015 among 2,016 adults (aged 18 and over) by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia via its Quick Query omnibus product.

Figures were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online.
All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, the words “margin of error” are avoided as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal.
Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in our panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

ralph,Prop 13: Winners and Losers From America’s Legendary Taxpayer Revolt,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/prop-13/,2016-11-30,"California homeowners saved more than $12.5 billion in property taxes last year because of Proposition 13, with long-time residents in more affluent cities receiving the biggest breaks.; Corrected on Nov. 30 at 1:30 p.m. ET. See below.
California’s Proposition 13 is the voter initiative that homeowners love, local governments hate, and politicians consider a third rail. On one hand, the state law caps both the property tax rate and the rate at which the assessed home value can increase. On the other, it reduces the long-term revenue stream that local governments rely on to fund public education, services, and infrastructure. But who is really benefiting from it?
Using public tax records, census data, and our own property-level housing value estimates, we calculated the effective property-tax rate – that is, the amount of property taxes homeowners pay relative to the current market value of their home – for each home and municipality in California. We found that:
In 2015 alone, California homeowners received over $12.5 billion in savings from Prop 13, while local governments lost that same amount.
More than 40% of California property owners have an effective property tax rate of less than 0.5%, which is half of the the 1% ceiling imposed by Proposition 13.
At the city level, households in expensive areas such Palo Alto and Los Altos where median home values exceed $2 million, pay effective tax rates of under 0.5%, while households in inland Beaumont and Arvin where home values are under $265,000, have effective tax rates above 1.3%.; Proposition 13 and Effective Property Tax Rates
Californians approved Proposition 13 in 1978. The law reduced their property tax rates to 1% of home value while capping annual appreciation of the home for taxation purposes at 2% per year. Prop 13 also prohibits reassessment of a home until it changes hands or undergoes significant renovation. The latter is a critical component of the proposition, as it means the effective tax rate is in essence a function of how long a property owner owns their home. The longer a homeowner owns their home, the lower their effective tax rate becomes. This was one of the main arguments of Prop 13 proponents: limiting the rate of property tax increases allows older, more economically vulnerable households to not get priced out of their homes because of tax increases.; How Prop 13 Works
Let’s say a homeowner buys a home in California for $100,000 (not realistic, we know). The county assessor will assess the property at $100,000, and the 1% property-tax cap imposed by Proposition 13 means the property tax bill will be $1,000. Let’s assume in the following year the market value of the home increases by 9.5% (the average annual rate of home value appreciation in California) to $109,500. Because of Prop 13, the assessed value can only go up by 2% to $102,000. Applying the 1% property tax rate to the new valuation of $102,000 leads to a property tax bill a year later of $1,020, which is an effective-tax rate of 0.9%, a reduction of 0.1 points.
After 20 years of ownership, the property is worth over $600,000, but because of Prop 13, property taxes have only increased to $1,486. This leads to an effective rate of about 0.2%. As the chart above illustrates, the more market values increase over the allowed tax increase of 2%, the further effective property tax rates fall below 1%. In effect, Prop 13 incentivizes long-time residents to stay in their home because moving would entail an increase of property taxes to current market value of their new home.; In fact, when we look at the amount of property taxes that Californians paid last year relative to what their homes are worth, property tax payers were relieved of about $12.5 billion. We calculate this by comparing what property owners would have paid in 2015 if their property were at assessed at 1% of the 2015 market value to what they actually paid in 2015. Furthermore, we also find that a large majority – more than 71% of Californians – pay less than a 1% effective rate and over 40% pay less than a 0.5% effective rate. However, the geographical pattern of where these taxpayers live in California isn’t uniform, as we show in the next section.; Households in Most Expensive Cities Paying Lowest Property Tax Rates
What’s more, residents in cities with higher home values and a higher share of long-term residents pay the lowest effective property tax rates in the state. And for the most part, these cities lie in expensive coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area and Coastal Southern California. Median home values in each of the ten cities with the lowest effective property tax rates are all above $1.2 million. In addition, half of top 10 cities with the lowest effective property tax rates are in the heart of pricey Silicon Valley: Palo Alto, Millbrae, Los Altos, Burlingame, and Sunnyvale. Four are in Coastal Southern California – Malibu, Manhattan Beach, Laguna Beach, and Beverly Hills – while the last is the exclusive Central Coast town of Santa Barbara.; California Cities with Lowest Effective Property Tax Rates

NOTE: Among California cities with at least a population of 10,000. For purposes of this report, we do not classify unincorporated census designated places as cities even though some may have legal authority to collect property taxes. Effective tax rates and median home value are source from Trulia public record and home value data, while share of residents living in cities since 1979 is sourced from 2014 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data.; What explains large cross-city variation in effective property tax rates? Conceptually, three factors: (1) price appreciation, (2) share of long-time residents, and (3), new housing growth. As discussed previously, price appreciation and resident tenure go hand in hand. The more prices appreciate in a community, the lower effective property tax rates become, which in turn, provided incentives for existing homeowners to stay put. Cities with more new housing growth, on the other hand, will likely have higher effective tax rates because a larger share of new residents and thus more properties recently assessed at current market value.; Residents in cities that have experienced greater home value appreciation over the past 15 years have lower effective tax rates. In fact, when comparing city-level data on the three factors mentioned above, we find strong correlations with median effective property tax rates across California cities. The strongest correlation is between effective tax rates and home value appreciation between 2000 – 2015 (coefficient of -0.53 and significant). The share of long-term residents in a city as well as the rate of new housing growth are significantly correlated with tax rates, but at slightly lower magnitude of -0.47 and 0.38, respectively, meaning that cities with more long-term residents and little new growth have lower effective tax rates.
What does this all mean for property taxation and policy in the Golden State? From a taxation perspective, it means that new homeowners in California are taxed disproportionately higher than existing residents. It also shows there is geographic disparity in who benefits from Prop 13 – residents in expensive coastal cities pay noticeably lower tax rates than residents in cheaper inland cities, although some of the disparity is likely due to differences in where long-time Californians live compared to new arrivals. Last, we unfortunately don’t think these findings matter much for policy. Homeowners won’t likely increase what is arguably their second largest tax bill through referendum and, as a result, politicians would also be unlikely to touch the property tax third rail through legislation.
 
This post has been corrected to reflect accurate values representing the “Share of Residents Living in City Since At Least 1979” in the table labeled “California Cities with Highest Effective Property Tax Rates”. An earlier version of this post had the incorrect values in the aforementioned table.; Our estimate of effective property tax rates is based on property-level estimates of home value and parcel-level property tax data for 2015. We calculate the effective property tax rate for each single-family/condo/coop in California by comparting (1) the actual amount of property taxes paid in 2015, dived by (2) the 2015 Trulia home value estimate."
ralph,"Case-Shiller Surpasses Pre-Recession Peak in September, but Recovery Uneven",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller-sept-16/,2016-11-29,"Gains mostly seen in the South and West; The National Case-Shiller Home Price Index surpassed its pre-recession peak in September, but crossing this threshold is largely symbolic. After controlling for inflation, home prices in the U.S. are still about 20% below the peak.
Home prices reaching their nominal pre-recession peaks brings mixed news for the housing market.It’s good news for homeowners who are no longer underwater, but not so great news for homebuyers who have seen prices outpace incomes for most of the housing market recovery.
The housing market recovery has been very uneven across the U.S. When controlling for inflation, markets that have reached their pre-recession peaks are few and almost exclusively in the West and South. And within those markets, it’s mostly high-end homes that have surpassed the peak.
Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5.5% year-over-year in September, which is the 53rd consecutive month of positive gains. Home prices is September also crossed their pre-recession peak, but doing so is largely symbolic. This is because after controlling for inflation, median home prices in the U.S. are still about 20% below the peak reached in 2006. That said, home prices reaching their nominal pre-recession peaks brings mixed news for the housing market. It’s good news for homeowners who are no longer underwater, but not so great news for homebuyers who have seen prices outpace incomes for most of the housing market recovery.

 
Furthermore, the U.S. housing market recovery has been both limited and uneven. Just seven metros – Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Denver, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Tulsa, and San Francisco – have seen prices of starter homes, tradeup homes, and premium homes surpass their pre-recession peaks. In addition, only two markets outside of the West or South have seen recovery at all from their pre-recession peak in any segment: Pittsburgh and Buffalo in both tradeup homes and premium homes. This uneven housing market recovery reflects the nature of the broader economic recovery: job, wage, and population growth has occurred disproportionately in the South and West.; Metros where Starter Home Prices Have Recovered

ralph,"November New Home Sales Up, With Room To Grow",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-nov-16/,2016-11-23,"New home sales are up year-over-year, but there’s still much room to grow.; Looking past monthly volatility, the 12-month rolling total of new homes sales was the best in over eight years and boosts sales to 85% of the 50-year norm.
New homes are helping satisfy homebuyers constrained by low resale inventory, but sales have room to grow. In October, new home sales represented about 11.6% of all sales, which is less than half of the pre-recession average of 23.6%.
How will new home sales fare in 2017? While it’s still uncertain how a Trump administration will affect homebuilding activity, over half of all new home sales are in the red-leaning South, where homebuyer and builders may be feeling a renewed sense of confidence about the year ahead.
 New home sales in October were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 563,000, which is up 17.8% year-over-year. While October’s year-over-year number is statistically significant, the 1.9% drop month-over-month is not. A less volatile number to look at is the 12-month rolling total, which is up 13% year-over-year, and represents the best one-year span since August 2008. The increase over last year puts the 12-month total at 85% of the 50-year average, up 1 percentage point from September.; However, the 12-month rolling total of new home sales compared to the 50-year average looks like there’s a lot more room to grow when taking into account the size of the U.S. population. New home sales per 1,000 U.S. households was 4.7 in October, which is only 64% back to normal.; How many new home sales do we need for the market to look normal? If we compare the share of new home sales to total sales, that share needs to more than double. In October, new home sales made up about 11.6% of all home sales, which is less than half of the historical average of 23.6%. While it’s been tough for homebuyers to buoy existing home sales because of low inventory, it looks like there is much potential for new homes sales to run higher.; Last, how will new home sales fare in 2017? While it’s still uncertain how a Trump administration will affect homebuilding activity, over half of all new home sales are in the red-leaning South, where homebuyer and builders may be feeling a renewed sense of confidence about the year ahead. As such, both demand and supply is likely to benefit, at least in the short run, and we expect increases in sales to at least occur in Southern Red states."
ralph,What Can Trump do to Further Increase Inventory and Home Sales?,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/existing-home-sales-nov-16/,2016-11-22,"While home sales slowly recover to their pre-recession average, tight inventory continues to plague buyers and hold back growth. We encourage President-Elect Trump to focus on policies that encourage existing owners to sell and homebuilders to build, rather than fixating on policies that boost demand.
If home sales are to drive up to their pre-recession levels, we’ll need to see inventory continue to pick up, not fall. October’s 10.4% fall in inventory over last year is yet another reminder that the housing market still faces headwinds towards a full recovery.
President-Elect Trump could help boost inventory by implementing policies that would encourage investors to sell homes they bought during the foreclosure crisis, many of which are suitable for starter home buyers. Such policies could include a reduction in capital gains taxes for homes sold by investors to owner-occupiers, an increase in tax rates on rental income, or both.
Existing home sales increased 2% in October, increasing for the second straight month. When compared to the pre-recession average and adjusting for the fact that there are more households in the U.S., October’s numbers are about 86% back to normal, up from 84% last month.; Existing sales are slow to come back because of persistent low inventory. The number of homes on the market fell yet again in October, dropping 10.4% year-over-year. However, inventory still appears to be showing signs of growth when controlling for seasonality and the number of households in the U.S. When taking seasonality and the number of U.S. households into account, existing inventory increased slightly from September, but is still only 67% back to normal, up from 65% last month.; How could President-Elect Trump help boost inventory? Amongst other policies, he could incentivize investors to sell homes purchased during the foreclosure crisis. Such incentives could include capital gains tax breaks on homes sold by investors to owner-occupiers, tax increases on rental income, or a combination of both. While not a silver bullet, when combined with demand-side incentives, these policies could help buoy demand for, and supply of, starter homes. We encourage President-Elect Trump to focus on policies that encourage existing owners to sell and homebuilders to build, rather than fixating on policies that boost demand, since addressing the latter without the former could lead to price increases and a drop in affordability."
ralph,November Housing Starts Jump but Have a Long Way to Go,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/november-housing-starts-16/,2016-11-17,"Controlling for the number of household in the U.S., housing starts are only about 66% of their 50-year average. Clearly, the homebuilding sector represents an industry that has potential to grow under a Trump stimulus plan.
A big question heading into 2017 is how homebuilders will fare under a Trump administration. While we think some of his broader economic policies might hurt builders, such as immigration and trade policies that could restrict both labor supply and raw materials, we also think he’ll likely implement builder-friendly policies, such as infrastructure stimulus and financial sector reform.
President-Elect Trump could implement a number of policies to help push the number of starts toward their historical average, but there’s a long way to go. Though Mr. Trump as discussed demand-side policies that would ease mortgage lending, such as Dodd-Frank reform, we encourage the President-Elect to also focus on supply-side policies given inventory shortages across the country.
Housing starts in October were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1,323,000, which is a large jump of 25.5% year-over-year and 23.3% month-over-month. The increase was so large, in fact that, both changes are statistically significant-a rarity in U.S. Census data releases. That said, the historical view looks like there’s much room for housing starts to grow. When taking the long view and controlling for the number of households in the U.S., housing starts are still only 66% of the 50-year average. To put October’s numbers into context, housing starts per household are about where they were in March 1993.

A big question heading into 2017 is how homebuilders will fare under a Trump administration, especially given the slow recovery to historical norms. While we think some of his broader economic policies might hurt builders in the long-run, such as immigration and trade policies that could restrict labor and raw materials, we also think he’ll implement builder-friendly policies that boost both demand and supply. Supply-side policies might include tax incentives for homebuilders, especially for those targeting the starter home market, while demand-side policies could include GSE and Dodd-Frank reform that might loosen credit availability. We encourage the President-Elect to focus on supply-side policies, especially given persistent inventory shortages around the country, and caution that pumping up demand without boosting supply is only likely to worsen affordability problems and household debt."
ralph,Housing and President-Elect Trump,Housing Policy,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-president-elect-trump/,2016-11-09,"Looking across the political and economic horizon, it’s tough to tell the fog from the clouds.; As some Americans woke up shocked to the news that Donald J Trump is President-Elect on November 9th, global markets went through turmoil not seen since the onset of the global financial crisis. Both the shock and turmoil are due to what has been perhaps the only consistent theme of President-Elect Trump’s campaign: unpredictability. As an ardent student of the housing market, I also see clouds on the horizon but it’s tough to decipher the clouds from the fog. If clouds are likely to build going forward, the consolation is that they are likely to be very different from the clouds that appeared during the start of the housing market crash ten years ago. Here’s my take on what I see ahead for housing during the Trump administration.
The foreground looks rocky but predictable, and mortgage refinancing may rise. A rocky road is no fun to tread on, but at least we know where the obstacles lay. Uncertainty tends to drives investors towards safe bets, such as U.S. bonds, which pushes down mortgage rates and makes borrowing cheaper. This happened during Brexit as the world looked to a stable U.S. economy for safe harbor, but there’s an important difference between Brexit and a Trump victory: the US economy now looks less safe because we don’t know Trump’s policies towards trade. This is actually pushed bond yields higher this morning as investors hold off on purchasing U.S. bonds. At the same time, mortgage rates could stay low if investors are seeing safe yields in U.S. mortgage backed securities, reflecting the relative safety of the U.S. housing market. Furthermore, the Fed is likely to delay a December rate hike because of this uncertainty. Both effects could mean a short term win for borrowers, and we’ll likely see an increase in mortgage refinancing if rates fall. On the other hand, if investors pull out of mortgage backed securities and bonds, rates will likely rise. This could also spur refinancing as homeowners race to hedge against future rate increases.
The middle ground looks foggy, blocking our view of the weather ahead. The shock of a Trump victory will be both a boon and drag on confidence of American homebuyers. Homebuyers in economically healthy blue states will likely be rattled and more hesitant about the future the US economy, which will curb their interest in making large investments. In economically stagnant red states, on the other hand, homebuyers will likely feel a surge of confidence that could bolster demand. Though these geographically polarized effects may help housing markets converge between the Costly Coasts and the Bargain Belt, the net effect on U.S. consumer demand for homes will remain unclear. If it’s negative, housing markets could take a severe long-term hit consumer confidence plunges, profits start to wane, employers cut back on hiring, and (gasp!) the U.S. dives into a recession. If it’s positive, we may see prices and rents in red-states catch up with blue-ones and an economy that grows more geographically even.
Because of the fog, we can only rely on barometer readings. Perhaps most uncertain about a Trump presidency is what will happen to housing markets because of policy change. Trump hasn’t much discussed housing policy during his campaign, but he has hinted to “Make America Great Again” by boosting the homeownership rate through demand-side policies, such as financial deregulation, rather than through supply-side policies such as reducing local impediments to new supply. Like other markets, prices are likely to rise further if policies lopsidedly target demand without also addressing supply. In few other industries than housing is addressing supply equally as important as demand for mitigating affordability pressures, and we advise President-elect Trump to take a more balanced approach to the housing market as President Obama. Last, and perhaps more disturbingly, President-Elect Trump has hinted at defunding the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the primary arbiter of affordable housing policy at the federal level. While local and state policies are likely to be unaffected, major programs – such as the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Section 8 housing vouchers – could be on the table for reform. Regardless if, or how, Trump reforms these programs, we hope he doesn’t lose sight of the millions of Americans who struggle to afford housing on a daily basis.
One final note: In late June we surveyed Americans about which candidate, Trump or Hillary Clinton would be better for housing. For what it’s worth, more Americans (39%) thought prices would rise under a Trump presidency than a Clinton one (29%). Perhaps more strikingly, millennials and younger voters, aged 18-34, were more likely to believe housing prices would rise under Trump vs. Clinton, by a margin of 49% to 26%."
ralph,Two Views of the Homeownership Survey,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/homeownership-survey-q316/,2016-10-27,"The homeownership rate is likely to get worse before it gets better, but will get better.; The Census Homeownership and Vacancy Survey released Thursday shows that the U.S. homeownership rose over the quarter to an unadjusted rate of 63.5%, up from a historic low of 62.9% last quarter but down slightly from last year. Optimists and pessimists alike have fodder for their cause. On the optimist’s side, household formation – whether it’s from new renter or new owner households – is good for both the housing market and the general economy, as some renters eventually become owners and new households drive demand for home-related goods and services.  On the pessimist’s side, there are headwinds for those that want to own a home but can’t: prices and rents have outpaced incomes, credit standards are higher, and a high share of young households are still living with their parents. On the neutral side, the homeownership rate is not different from last year or last quarter when seasonally adjusted.
Given other evidence from the release, my views swing more with the optimists than the pessimists. Household formation surpassed 1.1 million, climbing from 944,000 last quarter. About 560,000 – or nearly half – of these households were owners, up from a loss of 22,000 last quarter. I think this is good news in light of the fact that millennials now make up the largest pool of potential new households. Though many are still living with their parents, they eventually will move out. First, they will rent, and as they settle down, and then they will buy. While we can’t know for sure they will own at rates of older generations, our survey work at Trulia shows 80% of Millennials want to own a home – the highest share of any cohort and the highest in the seven years we’ve run the survey. Given the headwinds, however, the homeownership rate is likely to get worse before it gets better."
ralph,"New Home Sales Surge, but Demand Does Too",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-sept16/,2016-10-26,"New home sales per household are still about 36% below the long-run average.; Gains in new home sales continue, but some of the large year-over-year jump was due to a low bar set in September 2015. That said, year-to-date new home sales also grew strongly at 13.1% year-over-year, which reflects healthy demand for new homes by otherwise inventory-constrained homebuyers.
If we look past the monthly volatility by using the 12-month rolling total of new home sales, September was the best month since August 2008. By historical standards, however, new home sales per household are still about 36% below the long-run average.
New homes comprised 11.8% of all home sales in September, increasing for the seventh straight month. As new construction continues its upward march, we should expect the share to continue to increase accordingly. While new home sales represented about 11.8% of all sales, it’s still less than half of the pre-recession average of 23.6%. Clearly, there is still much potential for new housing to relieve inventory-constrained buyers.
New home sales in August were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 593,000, which is up 29.8% year-over-year. It’s important to note, however, new home sales a year ago set a low bar as September 2015 was the lowest since November 2014. Still, September was the third straight month of great news for homebuilders as they continue to meet pent-up demand from inventory constrained buyers.
While September’s increase is statistically significant, the range is wide: the true number could be as low as 6.4% or as high as 53.2%. A less volatile number to look at is the 12-month rolling total, which is up 12.4% year-over-year, and represents the best one-year span since August 2008. The increase over last year puts the 12-month total at 84.1% of the 50-year average, up 0.7 percentage points from August.

However, the 12-month rolling total of new home sales compared to the 50-year average looks a little worse when taking into account the size of the U.S. population. New home sales per 1,000 U.S. households was 4.7 in September, only 64.3% back to normal but up from 63.4% last month.

Home prices in San Francisco reversed their eight month cooling trend. While good news for existing homeowners, it’s unwelcome news for homebuyers who continue to experience declining affordability in the least affordable U.S. market.
Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5.3% year-over-year in August, which is the 52nd consecutive month of positive gains. August home prices were up from July’s 5% increase.

Earlier this year, price growth slid for five consecutive months and raised questions about where home prices were heading. We’re now seeing a reversing of that trend. While the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is an important metric to watch, it’s worth noting that the measure is more reflective of price movements in premium homes rather than middle or lower-tier homes.

Prices in San Francisco reversed their eight month cooling trend, ticking up to 6.7% growth in August from 6% in July. While good news for existing homeowners, it’s unwelcome news homebuyers experiencing continued affordability pressures. Further up the coast, Seattle and Portland continue to see a strong resurgence in prices after noticeable cooling between 2014 and 2015.

ralph,"Rent vs. Buy: Be Haunted by Prices, Not Rates",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/rent-vs-buy-oct-2016/,2016-10-20,"Buying a home is 37.7% cheaper than renting on a national basis, which is up just a bit from last year. Though the Fed is likely to raise rates by year’s end, homebuyers should be more concerned about rising prices.; Ghosts. Goblins. Ghouls. Mortgage Rates. Which should homebuyers be most scared of this fall? Only the ones starting with G. While the Federal Reserve Bank will likely increase interest rates later this year, rates would have to turn sharply higher to push the rent vs. buy decision towards renting. In fact, nationally and in the 100 largest markets, rising home prices are more likely to have an impact on homebuyers’ bottom line than increasing rates. In this edition of Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy report, we look at where, and by how much, rates and prices would have to increase to erase the financial benefits of homeownership. We find that:
Nationally, the benefits of lower mortgage rates have been mostly offset by higher prices. For households who move every seven years and can afford to put 20% down, it’s 37.7% cheaper to buy this year. This up just slightly compared to 37.2% last year.
Buying is cheaper than renting in each of the 100 largest metros. The range is from over 50% cheaper in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to under 20% in Honolulu and San Francisco.
Homebuyers should be more concerned about rising prices than rising mortgage rates. Rates would have to more than double to wipe out the financial advantage of buying, whereas prices would only need to increase by 67%. In San Jose, Calif., prices would only need to go up by 24% for the cost of buying to be the same as renting, whereas rates would have to jump by 45% – or 1.6 points – for buying to cost the same as renting.; Mortgage rates – as measured by average rates reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association – have dropped sharply over the past year from 3.9% to 3.7%, but buying has only become a little cheaper than renting. It is now 37.7% cheaper to buy than rent on the national level and that’s only slightly better than this time last year, when buying was about 37.2% cheaper. What gives? Home prices have outpaced rents, which erased most of the savings that homebuyers received from lower mortgage rates. Nationally, prices have increased by 5.9% since last year compared to an increase of 3.5% for rents. But thanks to low mortgage rates keeping pressure on prices, buying a home today continues to be the best deal since 2012.

 
Those trying to decide whether to buy or rent a home this fall will have the easiest decision in the South. Eight of the 10 metros that offer the largest financial advantage of homeownership are there, with Philadelphia and Syracuse, N.Y., being the only non-Southern markets to make the list. Buying a home in Miami and West Palm Beach, Fla., will be the easiest on your wallet: after seven years of homeownership, buying a home is 53.2% cheaper than renting. Buying a home in nearby Fort Lauderdale isn’t a bad deal either, where homeownership is 52.9% cheaper.; U.S. Metro

Note: Negative numbers mean that buying costs less than renting. Data for all metros and all scenarios presented in this report can be downloaded here.; There are some markets, though, where the tipping points are relatively lower. Prices in Honolulu, San Jose, and Milwaukee would only need to rise between 23% and 27% to reach the tipping point, while rates on the hand rates would need to increase between 44% and 80%. While such a large increase is unlikely to occur anytime soon, the point is that any threat to the financial benefits of homeownership are more likely to come from price pressures than rate pressures since rates would have to go up by a much larger proportion than prices to affect the rent vs. buy decision.; It is slightly cheaper to buy than rent this year compared to last. While rates have dropped significantly compared to last year, rising prices have eroded much of the financial benefits of lower rates that would accrue to homebuyers. Homebuyers should also be more concerned about prices outpacing rents than any possible rate hike by the end of the year. This is because the tipping point for rates is proportionally much higher than the tipping point for prices. In other words, rates would have to go up much more than prices for the costs of buying a home to be parity with the cost of renting. But buyers don’t need to fret too much. Even in markets where it the rent vs. buy decisions is toughest, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would have to raise rates aggressively. For example, in Honolulu and San Jose, the FOMC would have to increase six times at a quarter point each to reach the tipping point, and even if they did there’s no guarantee that mortgage rates would follow suit since they are more closely tied to the 10-year bond. On the other hand, price increases to the tipping point in some markets are not unprecedented. Prices in San Jose, on the other hand, climbed to near tipping point rates in 2013 at 21% year-over-year. Still, we think either scenario – aggressive price or rate increases – is unlikely to play out anytime soon. The FOMC has only raised rates once in the past 10 years, and prices would have to grow to their tipping with little movement in rents. The latter of which hasn’t happened since the housing market recovery began in 2012.; Trulia calculates the costs of buying and renting by:
We use our quality-adjusted measure of home prices and rents, which allows an apples-to-apples comparison between rental and owner-occupied housing units. We looked at median home value and rent in March 2016 in each of the largest 100 metros.
We calculate the initial total monthly costs of owning and renting, including mortgage payments, maintenance, insurance, and taxes.
We calculate the future total monthly costs of owning and renting, taking into account expected price and rent appreciation, as well as projected inflation.
We factor in one-time costs and proceeds, including closing costs, down payment, sale proceeds, and security deposits.
We calculate net present value, which reveals the opportunity cost of using money to buy a house instead of investing it. Net present value is the worth in today’s dollars of a future stream of payments and proceeds, taking into account expected interest rates.
Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy Calculator lets you compare renting and buying costs using other assumptions about prices, rents, and other factors. It uses the same math that powers our interactive map and this report. You can read our extended methodology here."
ralph,"Housing Starts Rise in September, But Momentum Slows",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-starts-september-2016/,2016-10-19,"The 12-month rolling total of housing starts was up year-over-year, but the rate of increase is slowing. Five of the past six months have shown slowing growth in starts, which means homebuyers will see fewer new homes come on to the market in the next six to 12 months.
While housing starts continue to inch up to their pre-recession average, they’re only about 75% back to normal. Housing completions, which represent tangible new supply for homebuyers, is even lower at 67%. Though homebuilders continue their slow and steady charge, there is much room for growth headed into 2017.
The 12-month rolling total of starts –which is a less volatile measure of new construction activity – grew 4.5% year-over-year in September to 1,142,900 starts. Though solid growth, it’s the fifth in the past six months where gains fell from the previous month. This puts housing starts in September at about 75% of the pre-recession historical average.

 
 
 
 
 
 
The rolling total of housing completions, which represent new supply to the market and lag starts by 6-12 months, grew by 7.9% in September to 1,022,000 completions and sit at 67% of their pre-recession historical average. The stronger growth in completions reflects the steady gains in starts from earlier in the year that builders are now finishing and bringing to market. While these completed homes bring welcomed relief to homebuyers, they shouldn’t get their hopes up about the new year. This is because the as the pace of starts slows, so will completions in early 2017."

Home prices in San Francisco and Los Angeles continue cooling in July, while prices in Seattle and Portland have another strong showing. The Pacific Northwest is to the housing market now what California was at beginning of the recovery: a beacon of strong gains in employment, income, and quality of life.
Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5.1% year-over-year in July, which is the 51th consecutive month of positive gains. July home prices bucked the previous five-month trend of smaller gains, but ticked up only marginally from June’s 5% increase. Combined with Census income data released earlier this month showing incomes grew 5.2%, this a positive sign that home affordability pressures may start to ease. However, incomes will need to outpace prices for several years in order to reverse the severe drop in affordability seen since 2012. While the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is an important metric to watch, it’s worth noting that the measure is more reflective of price movements in premium homes rather than middle or lower-tier homes.
 
Home prices in San Francisco and Los Angeles continue to cool in July, while prices in Seattle and Portland, Ore., have yet another strong showing. Prices in San Francisco cooled for the eight straight month, suggesting that affordability pressures and slowing job growth have finally taken their toll.  On the other hand, the Pacific Northwest is now to the housing market now what California was at beginning of the recovery: a beacon of strong gains in employment, income, and quality of life. Seattle and Portland have seen a strong resurgence in prices after noticeable cooling between 2014 and 2015, while San Francisco and Los Angeles have not."
ralph,New Home Sales Strong in August But Lag Historical Pace,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-august-16/,2016-09-26,"New home sales in August grew strongly, and cappedthe best 12-month span since September 2008. Post-recession, homebuyers continue to turn to new homes as the inventory of existing homes on the market dwindles.
The 12-month rolling total of new home sales were about 83% back to normal, but when taking into account the number of U.S. households, is only about 63% of the way there.
While new home sales are helping homebuyers constrained by low resale inventory, the share of all home sales made up by new homes is still low. In August, new home sales represented about 11.5% of all sales, which is less than half of the pre-recession average of 23.6%.
Although it’s been tough for homebuyers to buoy existing home sales because of low inventory, it looks like there is solid potential for new homes sales to run higher before the end of the current economic cycle.
New home sales in August were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 609,000, which is up 20.6% year-over-year. While August’s numbers are statistically significant, the range is wide: the true number could be as low as 6% or as high as 35%. A less volatile number to look at is the 12-month rolling total, which is up 11.1% year-over-year, and represents the best one-year span since September 2008. The increase over last year put’s the 12-month total at 83.4% of the 50-year average, up 1.4 percentage points from July.

However, the 12-month rolling total of new home sales compared to the 50-year average looks worse when taking into account the size of the U.S. population. New home sales per 1,000 U.S. households was 4.6 in August, only 63.4% back to normal. This comparison suggests today’s households aren’t buying new homes at the rates of past generations, likely due to fewer new homes being built but at a less affordable price.

How many new home sales do we need for the market to look normal? If we compare the share of new home sales to total sales, we need about double. In August, new home sales made up about 11.5% of all home sales, which is less than half of the historical average of 23.6%. While it’s been tough for homebuyers to buoy existing home sales because of low inventory, it looks like there is potential for new homes sales to run higher before the end of the current economic cycle."
ralph,Existing Home Sales in August Struggle Against Low Inventory,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/existing-home-sales-august-16/,2016-09-22,"Existing home sales fell again in August, and falling inventory continues to hold back home sales from reaching their pre-recession average.
Existing inventory in August hit another record low when controlling for seasonality and household formation, down again from a record setting July.
Inventory woes continue to introduce supply gridlock for homebuyers. Those who want to sell their home might not do so because finding another home is difficult. This introduces a first-mover problem into the home buying landscape.
Despite the decline in inventory, there are signs supply is on the rise in several markets such as San Francisco and Miami. What’s more, many of these markets have seen consecutive quarterly gains, suggesting an upward trend rather than a one-time blip.
Existing home sales dropped 0.9% for the second straight month in August to an annual rate of 5,330,000. When compared to the pre-recession average and adjusting for the fact that there are more households in the U.S., July’s numbers are about 81.9% back to normal. This is a drop from 82.9% last month.

Existing sales are slow to come back to normal because of continued inventory woes, as the number of homes on the market fell 10.1% year-over-year. However, inventory looks significantly worse when controlling for seasonality and the number of households in the U.S. Taking seasonality and the number of U.S. households into account, existing inventory took another dive and is set another record low, even eclipsing last month’s record setting plummet.

Despite the decline, there are some signs housing supply is easing. Trulia’s quarterly Inventory and Price Watch, released Tuesday, found that inventory in several markets is on the rise. What’s more, many of these markets have seen consecutive quarterly gains in available housing, suggesting an upward trend rather than a one-time blip. For example, inventory is up in San Francisco and Miami by 19.3% and 33.1%, respectively. For San Francisco it’s the fourth straight quarterly gain and the second straight for Miami."
ralph,"Down but Not Out: Inventory Falls Again, But Signs of Relief Emerging",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/inventory-q32016/,2016-09-21,"Nationally, home inventory falls for the fifth straight quarter. But there are signs that the number of homes for sale is recovering in several markets, including many markets in the West and Florida.; Note: we have added a data set for this report. For details see the methodology section below.
U.S. home inventory tumbled for the fifth consecutive quarter in July to near record lows, the longest streak of inventory decline since the housing market bottom in 2012.
Despite the decline, there are some signs housing supply is easing. Inventory in a few California and Florida cities is on the rise. What’s more, many of these markets have seen consecutive quarterly increases in available housing, suggesting an upward trend rather than a one-time blip. For example, inventory is up in San Francisco and Miami by 19.3% and 33.1%, respectively. For San Francisco it’s the fourth straight quarterly gain; the second straight for Miami.
In this edition of Trulia’s Inventory and Price Watch, we take a detailed dive into the markets where inventory is showing signs of picking up.
The Trulia Inventory and Price Watch is an analysis of the supply and affordability of starter homes, trade-up homes, and premium homes currently on the market. Segmentation is important because home seekers need information not just about total inventory, but also about inventory in the price range they are interested in buying. For example, changes in total inventory or median affordability don’t provide first-time buyers useful information about what’s happening with the types of homes they’re likely to buy, which are predominantly starter homes.
Looking at all the housing stock nationally and in the 100 largest U.S. metros from July 1, 2015 to July 1, 2016, we found:
Nationally, the number of starter and trade-up homes continues to drop at or near double-digit rates annually, while inventory has fallen less than 3.2% for premium homes;
The persistent and disproportional drop in starter and tradeup home inventory is pushing affordability further out of reach of homebuyers. Starter and trade-up homebuyers need to spend 1.7% and 0.9% more of their income than this time last year, whereas premium homebuyers only need to shell out 0.6% more of their income;
Low inventory is not a permanent condition. Several large markets expected to face long-term inventory shortages are now experiencing increases in inventory at double digit rates. For example, housing availability in San Francisco and Miami has grown by 19.3% and 33.1%, respectively.; Nationally, housing inventory continues to dive. This summer, the number of homes on the market dropped for the fifth straight quarter, dropping 6.7% over the past year. In addition:
The number of starter homes on the market dropped by 10.7%, while the share of starter homes dropped from 23.4% to 23%. Starter homebuyers today will need to shell out 1.7% more of their income towards a home purchase than last year;
The number of trade-up homes on the market decreased by 9.2%, while the share of trade-up homes dropped from 24.9% to 24%. Trade-up homebuyers today will need to pay 0.9% more of their income for a home than last year;
The number of premium homes on the market decreased by 3.6%, while the share of premium homes increased from 51.7% to 52.9%. Premium homebuyers today will need to spend 0.6% more of their income for a home than last year.; 2016 Q3 National Inventory Monitor

Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas. Share is the percent of for-sale homes that fall into each segment, which is defined separately for each metro. Median price for each segment is the stock-weighted average of the median price of each segment in each metro. Some point change estimates may be slightly different than stated values because our differing procedure occurs before rounding.
Falling inventory continues to take a toll on affordability. Starter homebuyers need to dedicate 38.5% of their monthly income to buy a starter home – a 1.7 point increase from last year. This figure is important because spending 38.5% of income towards a mortgage payment is larger than the 36% guideline used by GSEs such as Fannie Mae. While not a hard ceiling, applying for a mortgage with a debt-to-income ratio of more than 36% will make the mortgage approval process more complicated, especially when factoring in other debt like student loans, credit cards, and auto payments. Most trade-up and premium home buyers, and the other hand, are still in the clear. Each would need to spend just 25.5% and 13.9% of their income to buy a home, respectively, which are well below the 36% limit.; Low inventory has been the talk of the real estate world for much of the year, and rightly so. Inventory nationally, and in many of the largest markets, has been on the decline over the past several years, dropping by over 8% nationally since the third quarter of 2014 . But there are signs that relief may be on the way for homebuyers in some markets. Of the 100 largest markets, 21 have experienced increases in inventory over the past year, with many showing double digit gains. However, half of these markets are in just two states: California and Florida.

NOTE: Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas. Full data available here.
Homebuyers in Florida markets won’t need to look far to find more inventory. Five Florida markets saw gains in inventory over the past year, with Cape Coral-Fort Myers and Miami leading the country with increases of 36.7% and 33.1%, respectively. Two other markets in the greater Miami area – West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale – also saw noticeable increases at 17.8% and 15.9%. Sarasota was the market with the fifth-biggest increase, having grown inventory by 23.4%.
 
On the West Coast, homebuyers may be in for some relief heading into the remainder of the year. Notably, the two least affordable markets in the U.S. – San Francisco and San Jose – have both witnessed strong inventory growth over the past year, jumping by 19.3% and 8.7% respectively. San Diego also saw gains of 9.4% over the past year, while two inland California markets – Bakersfield and Fresno – had 10.6% and 24.4% more inventory than last year. This is cautiously optimistic news for frustrated buyers in the Golden State, who have seen prices soar whilst inventory remained flat over the past few years. While prices aren’t likely to fall anytime soon because of healthy demand, growing inventory may help moderate the strong price gains that these markets have experienced since market bottom in 2012.
 
While inventory is certainly on the rise in the Golden and Sunshine States, there are other notable markets where supply is on the rise. Inventory in Denver – which decreased over 10 consecutive quarters – rose by 2.8% in third quarter of 2016. Similarly, Phoenix showed its first increase in six quarters, growing by 6.9% over the past year.; Though inventory has increased in some markets, a one quarter increase does not make a trend. In fact, if we look at markets where inventory is trending upwards, that is, where inventory has increased at least three consecutive quarters, just four made the cut: Bakersfield, San Francisco, Sarasota, and West Palm Beach. Of these, Bakersfield has the longest streak, showing gains over 15 straights quarters. San Francisco has the second longest, with four consecutive quarters. The two Florida markets hit a trend with three straight quarterly gains.; While inventory is trending upwards in just these four markets, nine others are near-trending by having shown two consecutive quarters of gains. Of these nine, three six are either in California or Florida. San Jose, Calif., showed increases of 5.9% and 8.7% in the second and third quarters respectively, while San Diego showed similar increases of 5% and 9.4%. With Fort Lauderdale and Miami also near-trending, inventory in all three metros in the greater Miami metropolitan area appear to be on the upswing, with the former growing 10.3% and 15.9% and the latter 10.7% and 33.1% in second and third quarters, respectively.; Inventory continues to fall nationally, with starter homes and tradeup homes continuing to take the biggest hit. The further drop in inventory is also pushing declines in affordability, with starter homebuyers having to dedicate a larger share of their income towards a home than tradeup and premium buyers over the last year. However, we do have one big takeaway: nothing is permanent, not even low inventory. Notoriously stingy markets for homebuyers, such as San Francisco, San Jose, and Denver, are showing signs of picking up after prolonged periods of declines in 2014 and 2015. Finally, last week also brought some positive news for homebuyers: incomes are finally on the rise. Real incomes increased over 5% in 2015 according to the most recent U.S. Census Income and Poverty report. This was the largest annual jump in recorded history, and when combined with income growth, may help break what has been a gridlocked housing market as homebuyers experience gains in both income and choice.; Each quarter, Trulia’s Inventory Monitor provides three metrics: (1) the number and share of inventory that are starter homes, trade-up homes, and premium homes, (2) the change in share and number of these homes, and (3) the affordability of those homes for each type of buyer. For the first edition of this report, we back-calculate inventory for each quarter back to the first quarter of 2012 through the first quarter of 2016.
We define the price cutoffs of each segment based on home value estimates of the entire housing stock, not listing price. For example, we estimate the value of each single-family home and condo and divide these estimates into three groups: the lower third we classify and starter homes, the middle third as trade-up homes, and the upper third as premium homes. We then classify a listing as a starter home on the market if its listing price falls below the price cutoff between starter and trade-up homes. This is a subtle but important difference between our inventory report and others. This is because the mix of homes on the market can change over time, and can cause large swings in the price points used to define each segment. For example, if premium homes comprise a relatively large share of homes for sale, it can make the lower third of listings look they’ve become more expensive when in fact prices in the lower third of the housing stock are unchanged.
Our national metrics are a weighted sum of listings and weighted average of affordability of the 100 largest metropolitan areas and our inventory measure is an average of snapshots taken on the first of each month of the quarter. Last, we measure affordability as the share of income needed to purchase the median priced home in each segment relative metro household income terciles. To lessen the downward skew of income of households in the lowest tercile, we estimate starter homebuyer’s income using only household incomes of homeowners within this segment.
Note that though the U.S. Census released updates to the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) last week, which included new metropolitan level estimates of median income, we cannot yet update the income data used in this report because doing so requires individual survey records. Individual 2015 ACS survey records will not be available until later this Fall. The 2016Q4 Trulia Inventory and Price Watch will include updated these updated estimates.
Change to Methodology
Beginning this quarter and into subsequent releases, the Trulia Inventory and Price will include not only properties that are verified through public records, but all properties reported to us by Multiple Listing Services. In this report all data cited, including historical results, includes results from the additional MLS set. In previous releases of this report, we included just those that could be verified using assessor’s records. Including unverified properties into our sample did not change the underlying distribution of properties based on listing price, but, on average, did increase counts by about 10%."
ralph,Housing Starts Stable in August,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-starts-august-2016/,2016-09-20,"Housing starts were nearly flat in August, leaving the 12-month rolling total 20% below the 50-year average.; Housing starts slowed considerably in August, but the year-rolling total is still 7.5% higher than last year. Though a welcome relief for homebuyers stymied by low inventory, homebuilders still have a long way to go to meet historical norms.
While it’s tempting to compare to August housing starts to pre-recession peaks, homebuilders arguably built too many homes during this period. A better norm is the 50-year average, of which we’re still about 20% below.
Looking through the monthly volatility, the persistent gain in year-over-year starts reflects a healthy combination of homebuilder confidence and sustained demand for homes during a time of solid job and income growth.
New housing starts slowed in August, but the 12-month rolling total of starts – which is a less volatile measure of new construction activity – grew 7.5% year-over-year in August to 1,154,600 starts. Though solid growth, it the fifth straight month where gains fell from the previous month. While growth is slowing, this represents the most starts in a 12-month period since May 2007. While it’s tempting to compare to August housing starts to pre-recession peaks, homebuilders arguably built too many homes during this period. A better norm is the 50-year average, of which we’re still about 20% below.

Starts of single-family units continue to show strong growth over the past year, increasing 9.1% year-over-year. Multifamily starts increased as well to 4.9% year-over-year, but this was down from 6.3% in June. Though growth in single-family starts has taken the reigns from multifamily, growth in both types of units should be a welcome sign for both homebuyers and renters who have experienced prices and rents outpace prices for much of the current economic expansion.

While there are signs of slowing, the persistent gain in starts reflects a healthy combination of homebuilder confidence and sustained demand for homes during a time of solid job and income growth. With both employment and income growing strongly at a time when inventory is falling, it’s up to homebuilders to help ease demand pressures. While not a silver bullet, increases in homebuilding should help moderate price and rent increases headed into the fourth quarter."
ralph,Income Growth Helping Rich Cities and Poor Cities Alike,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/income-growth-census-2016/,2016-09-15,"Today, the U.S. Census released the first batch of data from the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS), which among other things, gives us a wealth of new data about economic and demographic changes at the metropolitan level. Following Tuesday’s surprisingly promising report on Income and Poverty in the United States that show incomes grew at highest annual pace on record, we took a look at the newly released ACS data to see how income growth in 2015 was distributed among U.S. metros. There is yet another surprise: the metros with the lowest incomes experienced the highest income growth in 2015, suggesting regional income convergence is picking up. While middle-income metros also experienced solid income growth, rising home prices in these markets erased any such gains.; Metros with the Largest Increase in Median Income

NOTE: Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, full data available here.; First, let’s take a look at places that had the highest income growth between 2014 and 2015. What’s surprising is that most of these metros – with the exception of Seattle – are not high-income markets. In other words, metros that were driving the 5.2% increase at the national level were some of the poorest markets, not the wealthiest. Nashville, Tenn.,  Birmingham, Ala., and El Paso, Texas, lead the pack with growth of 10.2%, 9.4%, and 8.7%, respectively, while notably high income metros in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Northeast didn’t make the list. In fact, the only two California markets to make the are the lower income metros of Fresno, Calif., and Bakersfield, Calif. What’s more, income growth in nine of these 10 markets actually outpaced housing price growth, which is good news for first-time homebuyers trying to save up for that ever elusive down payment.; We’re also seeing regional income convergence taking place more broadly across the country. Income convergence – that is, when income growth in lower income areas is larger than higher income areas – is important because it’s an indicator of how geographically even prosperity is distributed across the country. Regional convergence indicates more even geographic distribution of prosperity, while regional divergence indicates unevenness. At 5.3%, incomes in the lowest income metros actually grew faster than incomes in all others. And not only are incomes growing fastest in the lowest income metros, they’re also growing substantially faster than housing prices, which grew at 3.1%. Despite strong income growth in middle-income metros, home prices are still outpacing income in these markets. While incomes in the highest income metros also grew faster than home prices, the difference was small. Average income growth in the most expensive markets was 3.4%, only slightly higher than the 2.7% increase in prices.
Why are incomes growing? It’s tough tell at this stage, but we’ll have a much better idea when individual ACS survey records are released later in the year. In general, though, income growth can rise for a few different reasons. First, incomes tend to rise as the unemployment rate drops, the unemployed land jobs, and employers raise wages to attract labor. Second, incomes can increase because of increases in labor productivity, either because employees increase their skill base or because advancements in technology help workers be more productive. Last, incomes can rise because of firm and labor migration. As firms open new locations and bring new employees with them, the multiplier effect of local spending generates more opportunity for supporting business, even if new employees aren’t paid any more than existing ones. While we can’t be certain which processes are dominating in individual markets, near full employment at the national level is certainly helping increase wages regionally."
ralph,"Rich City, Poor City: How Housing Supply Drives Regional Economic Inequality",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/rich-city-poor-city/,2016-08-31,"Home values in the most expensive U.S. metros are diverging sharply higher from the rest of the country, fueled by strong income growth and scarce housing.; The U.S. housing market is growing more unequal. Over the past 30 years, prices in the 20 most expensive markets have risen much faster than prices in the 20 least expensive. What’s more, expensive markets almost always had bigger price gains compared to cheaper markets. In other words, the housing rich are getting richer while the housing poor are getting poorer.
Both trends suggest that economic convergence – the idea that over time, less expensive markets should “catch up” to more expensive ones – is not taking place. In fact, the most expensive housing markets in the U.S. are actually diverging from the rest of the pack, and as a result, long-time homeowners in the most expensive markets have had a much better return on their investment than homeowners in the least expensive. And much of the difference between high growth and low growth metros can be explained by two factors: income growth, and new housing supply.
We find that during the past 30 years:
The pack of most expensive markets is diverging from the rest. The priciest metros were 144% more expensive than the least expensive metros in 1986 but that differential has grown to over 319%.
Several markets we consider modern boom towns – such as San Francisco and San Jose – were also among the priciest 30 years ago, while others like Portland, Ore., Seattle, and Denver are the newcomers to the most expensive list.
There is wide regional variation in the amount of wealth generated from homeownership. Homeowners’ return on investment in Rochester, N.Y., and Wichita, Kans., have been +85% and +89.9%, respectively, while the return in San Francisco and San Jose has been +557.6% and +496.5%. This represents a cash return of approximately $50,000 in Dayton, Ohio, – the lowest cash return of the 100 largest metros – to nearly $900,000 in San Francisco.
The 30-year change in home value across the largest 100 metros is strongly correlated with income growth and new housing construction, while population and employment growth aren’t.; The financial fortune of homeowners in the U.S. has largely been determined by where they live. And since most households’ biggest investment is their home, regional disparities in home price growth may be effectively driving a geographical gap in wealth generation. Across the the 100 largest housing markets, homeowners that bought homes in the 20 most expensive markets 30 years ago have experienced much larger price gains than homeowners who bought in the 20 least expensive markets. In 1986, the average price of a home in the most expensive metros was $127,058, or 144% more expensive than the average price of $52,022 in the least expensive. By 2016, the most expensive metros grew to an average price of $493,504, or 319% more expensive that the average price of $117,827 in the least expensive metros.; Furthermore, the divergence isn’t just between the most expensive markets and the least. The 288.4% home value growth in the nation’s 20 most expensive has outpaced all others. For example, the 20 most expensive metros have grown from being 49.1% to 109.9% more expensive than the second 20 most expensive; 78.4% to 160.5% more expensive than the third; and 99.5.1% to 227% more expensive than the fourth. Clearly, those who were able to buy the most expensive homes in the U.S. have experienced a much greater return on their investment that the rest.; What’s more, the list of the most expensive metros has changed little between 1986 and 2016. In fact, 16 of the most expensive 20 markets in 2016 also made the list in 1986. Only four metros – Portland, Ore., Seattle, Denver, and Washington, D.C. – joined the ranks of the most-expensive U.S. home markets in 2016. These metros replaced Dallas, Hartford, Conn., Worcester, Mass., and Riverside, Calif., from the 1986 list of most expensive markets. Furthermore, only two of the new entrants to the top 20 entered recently. Portland and Denver ascended to the pricey ranks in 2015 and 2014, respectively. While Seattle and Washington have also joined the club, they’ve been in the top 20 for at least the past 17 years, with the former joining in 1991 and the latter joining in 1999.

The gist here is that the economic fortunes of homeowners who bought in the 1980’s have been tied closely to the random fortunes of U.S. geography. Homebuyers who were raised in, or migrated to, a few select areas of the country in the 1980s have experienced very different rates of home value appreciation than homebuyers in the rest of the country. Four areas in particular standout as homes to this exclusive “club:” the West Coast, Northeast, greater Washington, D.C., and Denver. All 20 of the most expensive markets in 2016 are in these four areas, and 19 made the list in 1986.; Across the U.S. over the past 30 years, there has been wide metro variation in how much value has been generated from homeownership. Homeowners in the 10 markets with the greatest appreciation have realized at least a 299% increase in homes value. In the 10 markets with the smallest rate of return over the past 30 years, homeowners were lucky to get a 100% return.

Returns on homeownership don’t look so great for those who bought homes in metros with the least returns. The smallest gains were in Rochester, N.Y. where the median homeowner gained just 85% in the value of their home over the past three decades. Several Texas metros also made the list, with homeowners in Fort Worth, El Paso, and Dallas gaining 90.5%, 95.4%, and 99.3%, respectively. Several other Southern metros had low appreciation, including Memphis, Tenn., Oklahoma City, Okla.,Tulsa, Okla., and Greensboro, N.C., None of the metros with the smallest home value gains over the past 30 years are west of the Rockies.; More generally, what explains these huge differences in price gains? While it’s hard to sort out all of the factors that might explain the differences, a few simple correlations help. After examining a wide range of demographic, economic, and housing measures, two factors stood out as being most strongly correlated with house price growth: (1) income growth and (2) the amount of housing construction relative to demand.; First, let’s take a look at income growth. The correlation between income growth and house price growth is large (0.66) and statistically significant. As the chart shows, three of the four metros with most income growth (San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle) are also among those that have experienced the highest growth in house prices, while many metros with low income growth have seen the smallest gain in house prices (Fresno, Calif., Memphis, Tenn., and Rochester). Yet there are many exceptions to this pattern: Sarasota, Fla., Oklahoma City, and Austin, Texas, have also had high income growth but have had lower price appreciation, while places like West Palm Beach, Ventura County, and Miami haven’t experienced much income growth but have seen strong price gains.
It’s not difficult to understand why such a tight correlation exists between income growth and price growth, but the relationship is likely more complex than you might think. As incomes rise, so do the mortgage amounts that homebuyers can get. Since homebuying is an auction-like process where the highest bidders win homes, income growth translates into higher home prices through increased consumption of housing. In turn, as home prices rise, employers need to increase their wages in order to retain employees. The kicker, though, is that growing incomes should only lead to increased home prices if supply is limited. When adequate supply is available, prices aren’t usually bid up because there are fewer buyers bidding against one another for any given home. This likely explains why income growth in the San Francisco Bay Area has been accompanied by strong home price growth, while income growth in Austin hasn’t.
Building on this (pun intended), we also find that metros with higher supply elasticity over the past 30 years have experienced less house appreciation, while metros with lower elasticity have experienced greater price appreciation. The correlation is also quite strong at -0.41 and statistically significant. As we discussed last month, elasticity is the measure of how much new housing is built relative to demand, and the strong negative correlation between supply elasticity and house price growth implies that much of the house price divergence we identified in the first section of the report can be explained by how much new housing was built in each of these markets over the past 30 years. We also tested for correlations with house price gains and 30-year population and employment growth. Both of these correlations were small and not statistically significant.; So what does all this mean? While we hesitate to make bold conclusions from just simple correlations (a more sophisticated analysis would be needed to detangle the complex relationships between elasticity and income, population, and employment growth), the implication is that a lack of housing construction in many metros may be driving nation-wide wealth disparities through persistent supply-induced home price appreciation. This is emphasized by the fact that those who bought homes in the most expensive metros in the U.S. have realized significantly higher returns on their investment than those that bought in the least expensive, and that supply elasticity is strongly correlated with house price appreciation. These findings are meaningful, since wealth is often passed down to future generations, who in turn might use such inheritance to also purchase homes, which continues the cycle of wealth accumulation. For example, those that bought the median priced home in San Francisco in 1986 gained $897,520 in wealth from their home, while those that bought the median priced home in Dayton gained just $51,789. This matters, since an $897,520 inheritance is likely to generate much more long-term wealth through housing or other investments than $51,789. And since the priciest metros continue to diverge from others, these geographic disparities are sure to persist into the near future.; We estimate annual home prices between 1986 and 2016 by first estimating home values as of Jan. 1, 2016 using Trulia’s internal measure of home values and chaining back to 1986 using the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s House Price Index for each of the largest 100 metropolitan areas or divisions where available. We then calculate home value quintiles using these home values, and then compare the average home value of each home value over time. Estimates of employment, population, income, and housing the housing stock are sourced from Moody’s Analytics estimates based on historical U.S. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data."
ralph,"San Francisco Home Prices Cool, Case Shiller Flat in June",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller-july-16/,2016-08-30,"June represents the fifth straight month of flat or decreasing year-over-year price gains, but homebuyers are still being challenged as prices outpace income growth yet again.
Home price growth in San Francisco drops for the fifth straight month, signaling the smallest gains since August 2012. Still, prices are up 6.4% and have a long way to go before incomes catch up.
Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5.1% year-over-year in June, which is the 50th consecutive month of positive gains. However, June is also the fifth straight month in which the year-over-year increase was smaller or flat than the previous month. Though this a sign that the U.S. housing market continues to stabilize, homebuyers are still being challenged as prices outpace income growth yet again. While the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is an important metric to watch, it’s worth noting that the measure is more reflective of price movements in premium homes rather than middle or lower-tier homes.

Prices in last month’s three hot markets – Portland, Seattle, and Denver – continue to lead the pack with increases between 9.2% to 12.6%. Though Western markets dominate U.S. price growth, San Francisco continues to show a noticeable cooldown. Home prices in the City by the Bay increased of 6.4%, which is the smallest annual gain since August 2012. The continued slowdown suggests the San Francisco housing market might start looking more “normal” by the end of the year, but the market still has a long way to go before most Bay Area homebuyers would agree."
ralph,Are McMansions Falling out of Favor?,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/mcmansions/,2016-08-29,"McMansions arguably were the biggest housing trend to hit suburban America in the last two generations. Have they lost their luster? It depends on where you go.; McMansions were the Big Macs of the housing market back in the early aughts: large, mass produced, delivered in a tight package (land), and looked the same regardless of where you bought one. They represented the biggest suburban housing movement since the first tract homes of Levittown, and have received criticism over the years from both design pundits as well as land use advocates. But have they fallen out of style? We set out with our good friend Patrick Clark at Bloomberg to investigate, and found that it really depends in which market a McMansion was made. Read Clark’s story.

First, the details: we had to come up with a concrete definition for the somewhat subjective idea of a McMansion. There isn’t a precise way to define a McMansion, but we settled on any home build between 2001 and 2007 that was roughly 1.5 to 2.5 times larger than the median sized new home in 2000, which works out to about 3,000 – 5,000 square feet. To track how these homes have recovered to all others, we compared the median home value premium for McMansions at market bottom in 2012 to the premium today.; Nationally, we’ve found the premium has fallen for McMansions from 138% in 2012 to 117% this year. However, the premium varies substantially by market. McMansions have taken the biggest hit in Florida. Eight of the 10 markets where premiums have fallen the most are in the Sunshine State, and each of the top 5 are there. Cape Coral-Fort Myers leads the pack, where McMansions have seen an 84.5 percentage point drop in their premium between 2012 and 2014. Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and West Palm Beach, round out the top 5, where premiums have dropped by at least 70 points. What’s more, premiums have dropped in 85 of the largest 100 U.S. housing markets. Milwaukee and Winston-Salem, N.C., have seen the largest increase in premiums, but just be a meager 12.5 and 10.8 points, respectively.; Metros with the Biggest Drop in McMansion Premium

NOTE: Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, full data available here.; Is this proof that McMansions are dying out? Not so much. While some homebuyers may certainly view them as an ugly, outdated relic of the housing bubble, there’s likely more fundamental factors at play. First, prices of the smaller and cheaper non-McMansion homes dropped more during the housing bust, but have made a stronger recovery than McMansions since market bottom. Second, homebuyers are willing to pay about 20% more for a new home compared to a used one, so at least some of the drop in these markets may due to the fact that these McMansions have lost their new newness."

Comparing yesterday’s stellar new home sales numbers with today’s existing home sales tells an important tale of two housing markets. Homebuilders continue to thrive on healthy demand while homebuyers remain stifled by anemic inventory.
Existing home sales dropped sharply by 3.2% in July to an annual rate of 5,390,000, which is down from June’s 1.8% increase.

This is a sharp drop from 85.6% last month.

Why are existing sales slow to come back to normal? Inventory woes. Inventory fell 5.8% year-over-year. However, inventory looks significantly worse when controlling for seasonality and the number of households in the U.S. Taking seasonality and the number of U.S. households into account, existing inventory is now the lowest on record (since January 1999).

July’s surge in new home sales continues to support the sentiment that demand for homes is strong despite homebuyers facing low existing inventory.
Looking past monthly volatility also confirms that July was a great month for new home sales. July shows the 12-month rolling total of new homes sales was the best in eight years and boosts sales to 82% of the 50-year norm.
New home sales in July were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 654,000, which is up 31.3% year-over-year. June’s large jump is a continued sign that demand for new homes remains solid in a low interest rate, low unemployment environment. However, it’s important to note that new home sales numbers from the U.S. Census are extremely volatile: the margin of error is wide and often includes zero, which means we can’t be certain whether these month-over-month or year-over-year changes actually increased, decreased, or stayed flat.

A better number to look at is the 12-month rolling total, which is up 10.6% year-over-year and up 2.7% month-over-month. Even from this vantage, it was the best 12-month rolling total of new homes sales in eight years, and boosted sales to 82% of the 50-year norm. This reflects a steady increase in demand from homebuyers, and should continue to boost homebuilder confidence over the remainder of the year."
ralph,"Housing Starts Hit 8-Year High in August, But Growth Is Slowing",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-starts-august-16/,2016-08-16,"Housing starts grew respectably in July, rising to highest level since May 2008, with multifamily starts showing a renewed increase in growth.; The rate of housing start growth is slowing. July represents the fourth straight month where the 12-month rolling total was flat or less than the previous month. Still, the total was the most starts in a 12-month period since May 2008.
Single-family starts are still growing at double-digit rates. Supply-constrained homebuyers should rest assured that relief is on the way.
The wave of single-family starts this year still isn’t showing signs of rising the tide for construction jobs. The number of construction jobs per housing starts hit a 10-year low in July, likely due to persistent labor shortages.
New housing starts grew solidly in July, but the rate was flat compared to June. The 12-month rolling total of starts-which is a less volatile measure of new construction activity-grew 8.5% year-over-year in July to 1,154,600 starts, which is flat from the previous month. While flat, this represents the most starts in a 12-month period since May 2008. The 12-month rolling total remains flat at 80% of the 50-year average of 1,442,163 starts.


Starts of single-family units continue to show strong growth over the past year, increasing 10.4% from a 12-month rolling total of 687,200 in July 2015 to 758,700 in July 2016. The share of multifamily starts in 5+ unit buildings showed a renewed increase in growth, jumping to 5.9% year-over-year in July from 3.2% in June.



Last, the number of units currently under construction per residential construction job turned downward again to 2.5 in July, which represents a 10-year low. Despite the recent increase in single-family starts, a combination of labor shortages as well as sustained multifamily construction (which tends to use less labor per unit) is keeping the residential sector from supporting more job growth."
ralph,Room to Roam: Where Starter Home Buyers Can Live Large,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/room-to-roam/,2016-08-03,"Looking for living space? Head to Texas and the South, where starter homes rank as the largest in the country. While Honolulu offers the smallest starter homes, it's also the best place to go big.; Size matters. As we reported last year, 43% of Americans told us they would like a larger home. The desire to upsize was even greater for millennials, with more than 60% wanting more living space. However, finding ample space is an easier exercise in some metros than in others because of differences in the existing housing stock.
To help young homebuyers looking for elbow room, we found those markets which have the largest and smaller starter homes across the country. As it turns out, everything really is bigger in Texas: not only do Lone Star metros top have some of the largest entry-level homes in the country, they also top the list of metros with the largest tradeup and premium homes. On the flip side, finding a spacious starter home in the Land of Aloha is tough, but trading up to more space isn’t.
In our pursuit to find where homes are largest and smallest across the U.S., we found that:
Austin, Texas, and Atlanta have the largest starter homes with a median size of over 1,300 square feet, while Honolulu and Detroit have the smallest with a median of under 950 square feet.
Houston and Colorado Springs, Colo., have the largest tradeup homes with a median size of over 1,900 square feet, while Detroit and Minneapolis have the smallest with a median of under 1,300 square feet.
Colorado Springs and Dallas have the largest premium homes with a median size of over 2,900 square feet, while Philadelphia and Detroit have the smallest with a median of less than 1,700 square feet.
While Honolulu offers the smallest starter home, climbing up the housing ladder to a tradeup home comes with an 82.3% increase – or 587 extra square feet – in space, which is the largest in the U.S.; Starter home buyers looking to go big for their first home would do best in the South. Of the 10 markets with the starter largest homes, five are there. Austin tops our list, where the median size of a starter home is over 1,400 square feet. Atlanta follows closely in the number two spot with a median size of 1,344 square feet, while Newark, N.J., the Pennsylvania region that includes Montgomery, Bucks and Chester counties and Houston round out the top five.

Starter homebuyers looking to eventually move on up to a large tradeup home would also do well in Texas. Both Austin and Houston, which made the list of metros with the largest starter homes, also topped the list of metros with the largest tradeup homes. Houston ranks first with a median sized tradeup home of nearly 2,000 square feet, followed closely by Colorado Springs and Dallas where the median tradeup home runs at least 1,900 square feet. Austin and Raleigh, N.C., round out the top five with a median tradeup home size of just under 1,900 square feet.
While premium homebuyers would also do well in the lone star state, as both Dallas and Houston make the top 5, Colorado Springs has the largest premium homes in the country with a median size of over 3,000 square feet. Fairfield, CT and Montgomery County-Bucks County-Chester County round out the top five with a median sized premium home of at least 2,850 square feet.; While not all starter homebuyers think about the size of the home they might tradeup to someday, it is important to consider, especially if a growing family is in the cards. To find out where households stand to gain the largest increase in living space by trading up, we calculated the percentage change in square feet a household would receive by moving from a starter home to a tradeup home, and from a tradeup home to a premium home.

Those looking to climb the housing ladder in paradise should fret not. While Honolulu offers the smallest sized starter homes, it also offers the largest jump in space when moving from a starter home to a tradeup. Doing so home comes with an additional 82.3% – or 587 extra square feet – of space, which is the largest in the U.S. Those looking to initially live large in Texas can also do well trading up there. Of the five markets that offer the biggest increase in space climbing from a starter to a tradeup home, three in Texas: San Antonio comes in second with an increase of 51.7% – or 579 square feet – followed by Houston and Dallas with a jump of 51.3% and 49.7%, respectively.; Existing tradeup homeowners wanting to make a big jump would do best in Memphis, Tenn. Doing so would get you closer to Graceland than any other major market in the U.S, as moving from a tradeup up home to a premium would net you 67.4% – or 1,027 square feet – more living space. Memphis followed closely by the City of Angels, where trading up to a premium home comes with 65.7% – or 895 square feet – more house. West Palm Beach, Fla., Omaha, Neb., and Knoxville, Tenn., round out the top five with increases of 65.6%, 65.2%, and 64.7%, respectively.; To recap, home buyers look to maximize their living space will have the best chance to do so in southern markets, especially Texas. Every major market in the Lone Star State – Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio – offer large homes for all buyers. Starter home buyers looking to climb up the house size ladder quickly have their best shot in Honolulu and San Antonio, while those wanting to expand into premium space can live large in Memphis and Los Angeles. While it’s tempting to buy as much space as you can, it’s important to keep in mind that large homes come with other large costs: all that extra space means more home furnishings are more energy consumption.; To estimate the median size home of each price segment (starter homes, tradeup homes, and premium homes), we first define the price cutoffs of each segment based on home value estimates of the entire housing stock of single family homes, condos, townhouses, and co-ops in each market, not listing price. For example, we estimate the value of each single-family home and condo and divide these estimates into three groups: the lower third we classify and starter homes, the middle third as trade-up homes, and the upper third as premium homes. We then calculate the median size of all homes that fall into each of these segments."

San Francisco continues to cool, while the Pacific Northwest sees price appreciation.; The U.S. housing market continues to cool, as May represents the fourth straight month of flat or decreasing year-over-year price gains.
Home price growth in San Francisco home prices drops for the fourth straight month, signaling the city by the bay may have seen its day.
Though Western markets continue to dominate price growth, several markets east of the Mississippi are picking up. Year-over-year price growth Minneapolis and Washington, D.C both reached 22 month highs.
Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5% year-over-year in May, which is the 49th consecutive month of positive gains. However, May is also the fourth straight month in which the year-over-year increase was smaller than the previous month. This is a sign that the U.S. housing market may be cooling   in the wake of double digit price appreciation between 2012 and 2014. While the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is an important metric to watch, it’s worth noting that the measure is more reflective of price movements in premium homes rather than middle or lower-tier homes.

Prices in last month’s three hot markets – Portland, Seattle, and Denver – continue to lead the pack with increases between 9.5% to 12.3%. Though Western markets continue to dominate price growth, several markets east of the Mississippi are picking up. Year-over-year price growth Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., both reached 22 month highs.

Finally, growth in San Francisco home prices continues a noticeable slowdown with a year-over-year increases of 6.5%, which is the smallest annual gain since August 2012. The continued slowdown suggests the San Francisco housing market may finally be entering a phase of normalcy after years of sustained price appreciation, although persistent increases have left homebuyers struggling to find affordable homes.; New home sales jumped sharply in June, and marked the best month since February 2008. This is a continued sign that demand for homes remains solid and aptly reflects increasing homebuilder confidence.
The share of all home sales composed of new homes ticked upward to 10.6% in June, as new home sales continue to slowly ease the crunch of low existing inventory.
New home sales, as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau, jumped in June, and marked the best month for new home sales since February of 2008. The share of all sales made up of new homes ticked up to 10.6% from 10.4%, suggesting that new inventory continues to slowly relieve home buying pressure otherwise constrained by low inventory."
ralph,June Existing Home Sales Flat as Inventory Plagues Homebuyers,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/existing-homes-june16/,2016-07-21,"Though June’s existing home sales numbers show that we’re about 95% back to the pre-recession average, there are many more households in the U.S. looking for homes than in the early 2000s.
While slowly climbing upwards, inventory continues to plague homebuyers looking for a home. The month’s supply of existing homes in June 2016 was the lowest since June 2005.
A silver lining from tight inventory is that homes are selling faster, which benefits agents and sellers. Existing home sales per agent ticked up 
Existing home sales increased just 1.1% in June to an annual rate of 5,530,000, which is down from May’s 1.8% increase. June’s numbers also indicate that existing home sales are about 95% of the pre-recession average.

While approaching the pre-recession average, there are more households is the U.S. now that in the early 2000s. Despite existing home sales inching toward historical norms, supply remains low relative to demand. Seasonally adjusted, the month’s supply of homes in June 2016 was the lowest since June 2005, indicating that inventory problems still plague homebuyers.

Last, low inventory does have a silver lining. Homes tend to sell faster, which is good news for agents. In fact, the number of sales per real estate employee in June reached 3.56, which is the highest ratio since September 2015."
ralph,Mixed Story for June Starts as Multi-Family Slows,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-starts-june16/,2016-07-19,"Single-family grows strong, multifamily growth sputters, and new work from our team suggests delays in building approval is holding back supply.; June’s data release shows monthly starts are still about 20% below historical averages. Similarly, our new study finds the rate at which new housing is supplied relative to demand is about 15% below historical norms.
Single-family starts continue on a strong growth trajectory, while multifamily pulls back from what has been a heck of a ride over the past several years.
While restrictive zoning regulation is often named as public enemy number one, our latest research suggests delays in permit approval better explains why new supply is abundant in some areas and stingy in others. This is because zoning can be changed, while uncertainty over project approval cannot.
New housing starts grew solidly in June, but the rate slowed compared to May. The 12-month rolling total of starts-which is a less volatile measure of new construction activity-grew 8.6% year-over-year in April to 1,150,000 starts, which is down from May’s jump of 11.8%. While down slightly, this represents the second most starts in a 12-month period since August 2007. The 12-month rolling total remains flat at 80% of the 50-year average of 1,442,058 starts.

Starts of single-family units have also shown strong growth over the past year, increasing 12.3% from a 12-month rolling total of 676,700 in June 2015 to 760,000 in June 2016. The share of multifamily starts in 5+ unit buildings showed a large drop in growth, falling to just 3.2% year-over-year in June from 11.4% in May. While volatile, we may see multifamily starts turn into negative growth territory next month.
Last, we released a new report this morning measures the extent to which U.S. homebuilding is satisfying demand. Nationally, new housing supply relative to demand is about 15% below the historical average. Though restrictive zoning has taken much of the rap for limiting supply, we find that delays in the project approval process is more impactful. This is because zoning can be changed, while uncertainty over project approval cannot."
ralph,Is Your Town Building Enough Housing?,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/elasticity-2016/,2016-07-19,"Nationally, many cities are struggling with a lack of affordable housing. In others, a glut of housing helped wipe out the equity for homeowners in the crash. We look at how cities respond to housing demand. Whatever the local story – nationally, homebuilding is weak as prices are rising.; UPDATED 7/22 1:50 ET: This report has been updated to correct price-change data from a proprietary source to government data (FHFA). 
Builders are providing less housing now as prices rise than they have in the past.
Many places in the Southwest and Southeast actually provide ample new housing units when demand rises, but others in the Pacific West and Northeast don’t.
For every month delay in approving new building permits, a housing market’s ability to meet housing demand falters
Why do some places struggle with a lack of housing while others seem to have too much?
During the last two decades San Francisco and Pittsburgh have been stingy when it comes to homebuilding and prices have risen. Contrast those metros with Las Vegas and Atlanta, some of the biggest foreclosure casualties in the housing crisis.
We studied the rate of homebuilding and the market prices for the nation’s biggest metros during the last 20 years to determine how housing policy affected what we economists call “elasticity” – simply put: how much new housing is built relative to demand. Markets with greater elasticity build more housing relative to price changes than markets with lower elasticity.
We found that the rate at which the nation’s housing stock has grown relative to demand is low and that while elasticity has fluctuated during the last 30 years, builders are providing less housing now as prices rise than they have in the past.
Of late, land use regulation, and in particular, zoning, has been blamed for keeping supply low in many markets. That story, however, is a simplistic one that overlooks the nuances involved with how local governments actually employ zoning across the country. Our research finds that local bureaucracy, measured by building approval delays, affect housing supply elasticity rather than restrictive zoning. Our other findings – and keep in mind that the higher the elasticity number, the more housing is built to meet demand – include:
Nationally, long-run housing supply elasticity is at 0.17, three points below the 30-year average of 0.2, and just over half of peak elasticity of 0.29 in 1999Q4.
Long-run elasticity at the metropolitan level varies substantially, from over 0.8 in Las Vegas, Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, N.C., and Albuquerque, N.M., to under 0.05 in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New Orleans.
Local bureaucracy, rather than zoning, accounts for much of the difference in long-run supply elasticity across the country. For every month delay in approving new building permits, long-run supply elasticity drops by .03. We also find no statistically significant evidence that restrictive zoning reduces elasticity.; How much the housing stock changes relative to prices – called supply elasticity by economic wonks – is an important metric of housing market health. For perspective, a value of one indicates that a one percent increase in housing price is associated with a one percent increase in the housing stock over a given time period. Both natural restrictions as well as government regulation can affect how elastic a given market is. For example, it is naturally much more difficult to build new homes in places with steep topography surrounded by water – such as San Francisco – than it is in areas with a flat buildable landscape, like Phoenix. It is also easier to get approval for new development in areas with less regulation, such as New Orleans and Mobile, Ala., than it is in areas with more regulation, like Honolulu and Los Angeles. In this report, we take a look at how much the housing stock is expanding relative to demand nationally and in the 100 largest markets. We also estimate the relative impact of different types of land use regulation – as measured by the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulation Index (WRLURI) from the University of Pennsylvania – on housing market elasticity.; Over the last 30 years, long-run supply elasticity for the nation has fluctuated between 0.13 and 0.29. As of 2016Q1, that number was at a 0.17, down from 0.18 last year. So as a country, we are providing fewer new housing units as prices rise than we have in the past. Of course, the U.S. housing market is really a collection of individual metropolitan markets, and we find that elasticity varies considerably among them.; Markets with the Highest Housing Supply Elasticity

On the other hand, there are many markets where elasticity is low. New Orleans tops the list of least elastic housing markets, where house prices have increased by 80.7% over the past 20 years but the housing stock only increased 1.7%. While New Orleans has the lowest elasticity in the U.S., much of the reason is due to major the major loss of housing that occurred in the city from Hurricane Katrina. In addition, low elasticity isn’t much of a problem in other markets that have low elasticity, such as Buffalo and Scranton, Pa., as several of these have vacancy rates of 10% or more.
Taking into account vacancy rates are important when determining whether low elasticity is a problem in a given market, as a lot of empty new homes allows new demand to be absorbed into the vacant units and without the need for new ones. On the other hand, low elasticity is a problem in other markets that make the bottom of the the list. In some of these markets – such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose – home prices have tripled over the past twenty years, and affordability has fallen dramatically. For example, in San Jose – with an estimated elasticity of just 0.07 – middle class households have to spend about 13% more of their income to the median priced home compared to just four years ago, so supply is not keeping up enough to moderate affordability.; A natural question to ask: why are some markets more elastic than others? Much academic and industry research recently has targeted restrictive zoning as the culprit in preventing enough new supply from coming onto the market. After all, building 100 new homes on a lot is difficult to do if it is only zoned for 50. However, zoning is not always a binding constraint. Most local governments allow for landowners and/or developers to apply for a zoning change that would allow more units to be built than the existing zoning code allows. While costlier and more time consuming for land developers, a zoning change can theoretically allow zoning to more closely follow the market. In the example above, a developer might apply for a zoning change to allow for 100 units, but settle on 75 after consultation with local authorities and neighbors. The downside to pursuing a zoning change is that in some circumstances it can take several months or years to successfully navigate, which in turn, adds more cost and risk to a project. As costs and risk associated with a housing development increases, so too does the likelihood that it will be scaled down or not completed at all.
In fact, we find that metros with longer administrative delays in rezoning and lot approvals are strongly correlated with lower long-run housing supply elasticity than metro with fewer delays, while restrictive zoning is not. See methodology section below for detail of our analysis, which includes regression modeling of the WRLURI components.; In sum, the rate at which we are providing housing in the U.S. relative to demand is low compared to historical standards, but this varies quite immensely across the largest 100 markets. Many places in the Southwest and Southeast actually provide a decent number of new housing units when demand rises, but others in the Pacific West and Northeast don’t. While it is tempting to blame the most popular tool of local land use regulation, zoning, we find that it is actually delays in the building permit approval process that affecting the ability of builders to meet demand. This is because zoning can formally be changed, while uncertainty over building approval cannot.; To estimate long-run housing supply elasticity, we compare the 20-year change in a metro’s housing stock to the 20-year change in quality adjusted house prices. For estimates of the housing stock, we combine Moody’s Analytics estimates from 1970-2009 with Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program (PEP) from 2010-2015, and extrapolate forward to 2016 using Census building permit data.
For price change estimates, we use FHFA repeat sales data from 1975-2016.
For measures of land use regulation, we use the 2008 Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index (WRLURI) from the University of Pennsylvania, available for download and use here. The WRLURI is derived from a comprehensive survey of local governments across the U.S. on the types and performance of land regulation they employ. The WRLURI is composed of 11 sub-components that measure the restrictiveness of different types of regulatory measures. A brief description of each subcomponent is listed in the table below.
Using a simple regression analysis, we estimate the correlation of each regulatory measure indexed in the WRLURI (see table below for a description of each measure and regression results) with our estimate of housing supply elasticity across the 100 largest U.S. metros. While each regulatory measure is a subcomponent of the aggregate WLURI, only one – the approval delay index – is statistically significant in explaining why some metros have high elasticity and others are low. What’s more, regression analysis also controls for the intervening effect of other factors, so we can be sure that other measures in the index, such as restrictive zoning, are not confounding the result of approval delay. The impact is also relatively strong – each month of approval delay is correlated with a .03 decrease in housing supply elasticity. For example, over half of the -0.68 difference in supply elasticity between Honolulu (elasticity of 0.09) and Atlanta (elasticity of 0.77) can be explained by the difference in approval delays (13-month difference X -0.03 = -0.39). Surprisingly, one WRLURI measure most often blamed for stifling development – restrictive zoning – is not correlated at all with lower housing supply elasticity.
Much of the inspiration for this report comes from: Mayer, Christopher J., and C. Tsuriel Somerville. “Land use regulation and new construction.” Regional Science and Urban Economics 30.6 (2000): 639-662.

ralph,"Jobs Report: Strong June and May Revision, but Cycle Is Nearing the End",Housing Policy,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/jobs-report-jute-16/,2016-07-08,"U.S. job growth in June rebounded vigorously from a terrible May. While job additions remain strong, the rate of job growth in 2016 appears to be slowing somewhat compared to last year.; The June jobs report was perhaps the only one in recent memory where economists were just as, if not more, interested in the previous month’s revisions than the current month’s estimates. As it turns out, May was indeed a bad month, but June numbers ushered in relief that the U.S. labor market is doing well in a maturing economic cycle.”
Although the rate of year-over-year job growth appears to be flattening, the short-run impact on housing is likely to be negligible. Not only is tight inventory keeping prices buoyed in many markets, growth in residential construction employment is out pacing total job growth by a factor of two
Job growth in June rebounding vigorously from a weak and downwardly revised May, adding 287,000 jobs, or 2.1%, year-over-year growth. This was the 68thconsecutive month of year-over-year gains, and provides a welcome sign that the U.S. economy is healthy despite concerns over the health of the global economy. The downside of this month’s report is that the dismal numbers in May turned out to be even worse than initially reported, having added just 11,000 jobs, which is revised from 38,000.

Despite the solid June job numbers, the year-over-year job growth rate continues to slow from a post-recession high of 2.5% in February of 2015. While strong, the January to June 2016 job gains of 2.1% to 2.3% are failing keep up with the year-over-over gains seen at this time last year of 2.4% to 2.5%. This slowing growth reflects a maturing economic cycle. However, the impacts of slowing job growth on the housing market may be negligible in the short-run, given historically tight inventory.

On the construction side, job growth from homebuilding activity remains solid. The residential construction sector added 133,200 jobs year-over-year, or 5.5%growth, in June. This continued uptick reflects both a solid year for housing starts as well as increasing confidence of homebuilders headed into the remainder of the year."
ralph,Case-Shiller: Rapid Price Growth Slows Slightly in San Francisco,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller-may16/,2016-06-28,"The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index suggests the U.S. housing market is stabilizing as the rate of price gains slow for the third straight month. Prices in San Francisco continue to show noticeable cooling.; The U.S. housing market is showing increasing signs of stabilization, as April represents the third straight month of decreasing price gains.
Home price growth in San Francisco home prices drops for the third straight month, signaling a downward trend.
While the housing market continues to moderate, the rate of price gains is still outpacing income growth. Housing affordability continues to be a headwind for homebuyers in many of the country’s largest markets.
Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5% year-over-year in April, which is the 48th consecutive month of positive gains. However, April is also the third straight month in which the year-over-year figure decreased over the previous month. This is a sign that the U.S. housing market is stabilizing in the wake of double-digit price appreciation between 2012 and 2014. While the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is an important metric to watch, it’s worth noting that the measure is more reflective of price movements in premium homes rather than middle or lower-tier homes.
 
Prices in last month’s three hot markets – Portland, Seattle, and Denver – continue to lead the pack with increases between 9.5% to 12.3%. While strong price growth in these markets should help increase inventory in the coming months, homes will be significantly less affordable for homebuyers than this time last year.

Finally, growth in San Francisco home prices continues a noticeable slowdown with a year-over-year increases of 7.8%, which is the smallest annual gain since January 2015. The continued slowdown suggests the San Francisco housing market may finally be entering a phase of normalcy after years of sustained price appreciation, although persistent increases have left homebuyers struggling to find affordable homes."
ralph,New Home Sales Continue Surge in May,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-may16/,2016-06-23,"The share of all home sales composed of new homes ticked downward to 10% in May, but new residential construction continues to slowly ease the crunch of low existing inventory.
Homebuyers, constrained by persistent low inventory of existing homes, are increasingly turning to builders to satisfy their demand.
Homebuilders are continuing to sell a high share of homes that haven’t even been built yet, as frustrated buyers look to builder’s future inventory for relief.
New home sales decreased 6% in May, but much of the decrease was due to April’s large jump rather than a trended decrease in May. To put it into perspective, May’s figure of 551,000 is the second largest annual rate over the past year, eclipsed only by last month’s revised figure of 586,000. While a positive sign for both the U.S. economy and homebuyers, the share of all sales made up of new homes ticked slightly downwards, suggesting that new inventory relief for supply constrained homebuyers is slow to arrive.

Today’s numbers continue to show that the share of new home sales bought off a plan hovers near a 10-year high. Why? The inventory of existing homes continues to fall. Low existing inventory likely pushes prospective buyers away from existing homes towards new homes, and as new home sales rise, this allows builders to sell more new homes that haven’t been built yet."
ralph,Existing Home Sales Suggests Finding A Home Getting Tougher,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/existing-home-sales-may16/,2016-06-22,"Existing home sales increased just 1.8% in May to an annual rate of 5,530,000 which is up just a bit from April’s 1.7% increase. This suggests that while demand for homes remains healthy, low inventory of homes for sale continues to keep the U.S. home resale market from recovering to pre-recession levels.
Though steadily marching upwards, existing home sales hovers at about 94% of the pre-recession average of 5,875,300 units sold annually.
Low inventory, especially for starter and tradeup homes, continues to stifle home sales activity. Finding a home is increasingly a challenge for both first and second-time homebuyers.
May’s existing home sales numbers suggest that healthy demand continues to support a recovering housing market, but that inventory woes are preventing a full recovery to pre-recession levels.

Looking more broadly, our Inventory and Price Monitor – released yesterday – also finds that inventory woes continue to plague the housing market. This spring house-hunting season brought no relief for homebuyers, as inventory of all homes has dropped nationally by about 6% over the past year. In addition:
The number of starter homes on the market dropped by 12.3%, while the share of starter homes dropped from 25.6% to 23.9%. Starter homebuyers today will need to shell out 1.3% more of their income towards a home purchase than last year;
The number of trade-up homes on the market decreased by 11.5%, while the share of trade-up homes dropped from 26.3% to 24.8%. Trade-up homebuyers today will need to pay 0.8% more of their income for a home than last year;
The number of premium homes on the market decreased by just 0.2%, while the share of premium homes increased from 48.2% to 51.3%. Premium homebuyers today will need to spend 0.5% more of their income for a home than last year."
ralph,"No Inventory, No Problem: Why Supply Doesn’t Always Matter",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/inventory-2q2016/,2016-06-21,"It’s well known that inventory of homes has fallen steadily over the past few years. For starter homebuyers though, falling inventory isn’t always bad – in many markets, demand for starter homes is falling, and so are prices.; America has experienced a dramatic drop in inventory over the past four years, with starter and tradeup homes taking the biggest hit. In most markets, this drop is making homes more expensive and less affordable. However, low inventory need not always lead to a housing shortage and higher prices. After all, prices are determined by both supply and demand. It turns out, there are several markets – such as Columbia and Charleston, S.C., ­– where buyers for homes have dropped at a greater pace than the inventory. In this quarter’s Inventory and Price Watch, we take a look at these and other markets where falling supply has actually occurred at a time of waning demand.
Compared to other inventory reports, the Trulia Inventory and Price Watch offers homebuyers and sellers deeper insight into the supply and affordability of homes within different segments: starter homes, trade-up homes, and premium homes. Segmentation is important because home seekers need information not just about total inventory, but also about inventory in the segment they are interested in buying. For example, changes in total inventory or median affordability don’t provide first-time buyers useful information about what’s happening with starter homes.
Looking at all the housing stock nationally and in the 100 largest U.S. metros from April 1, 2015 to April 1, 2016, we found:
The number of starter and trade-up homes continues to drop at double-digit rates annually, but just less 0.2% for premium homes;
A lack of starter home affordability is becoming problematic in places outside of California. Starter home buyers in Oakland, Calif. need to spend about 8% more of their income to buy a home this year, but buyers in Denver, Portland, Seattle, and central Florida and starting to feel the same pinch;
Falling starter home inventory isn’t wreaking havoc everywhere: in 20 of the 74 metros where starter home inventory has fallen, waning demand has offset tightened supply, so prices have fallen.; This spring house-hunting season brought no relief for homebuyers, as inventory of all homes has dropped nationally by about 6% over the past year. In addition:
The number of starter homes on the market dropped by 12.3%, while the share of starter homes dropped from 25.6% to 23.9%. Starter homebuyers today will need to shell out 1.3% more of their income towards a home purchase than last year;
The number of trade-up homes on the market decreased by 11.5%, while the share of trade-up homes dropped from 26.3% to 24.8%. Trade-up homebuyers today will need to pay 0.8% more of their income for a home than last year;
The number of premium homes on the market decreased by just 0.2%, while the share of premium homes increased from 48.2% to 51.3%. Premium homebuyers today will need to spend 0.5% more of their income for a home than last year.; 2016 Q2 Inventory

Decreased inventory continues to take a toll on the affordability of all home segments, but especially starter homes. Starter homebuyers have been hit the hardest, and would need to dedicate 37.5% of their monthly income to buy a starter home – a 1.3 point increase from last year. Trade-up and premium home buyers haven’t been hit as hard, but still need to spend 0.8% and 0.5% more of their income to buy a home, respectively.; In our last report, we found that nine of the 10 metros experiencing the largest drop in starter home affordability over the past four years were located in California. However, only four of the 10 metros experiencing the largest drop in starter home affordability over the past year were located in California. While Oakland, Calif. still tops the list with starter homebuyers needing spend 8.3% more of their income on a starter home compared to last year, starter homebuyers in the Mountain West, Pacific Northwest, and Gulf Coast of Florida are beginning to feel the pinch. For example, starter home buyers in Denver need to spend 8.1% more of their income to buy a home this year, 6.1% and 5.2% more in Seattle and Portland, and 5.5% and 4.8% more in Cape Coral, Fla., and Sarasota, Fla.; Markets with Largest Decrease in Starter Home Affordability

NOTE: Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas. % change in starter home affordability is the additional share of income needed to purchase the median priced home compared to 2012 Q1.; One might think that falling starter home inventory over the past year would cause starter home prices to rise, and for the most part, that’s what has happened in most markets. In places like Portland, Dallas, and Colorado Springs, Colo., large decreases in starter home inventory has led to double-digit increases in starter home prices. However, price movements aren’t just determined by changes in supply (inventory) – they’re also affected by the number of homebuyers actively bidding on homes. In fact, in 20 of the 74 markets where starter inventory has dropped, demand has fallen at faster pace and so prices have fallen.
For example, starter home inventory has fallen by about 20% of the past year in both Columbia, S.C., and Charleston, S.C., but starter home prices have actually fallen in these markets by 0.8% and 5%, respectively. And these two cities aren’t outliers – 18 others large metros that have experienced a drop in inventory have also seen price drops, including New York, Kansas City, and Montgomery County-Bucks County-Chester County, Pa.; Markets Where Falling Inventory Doesn’t Matter

NOTE: Among the 100 largest U.S. metro areas.; On the other hand, falling inventory of tradeup and premium homes is occurring in metros where demand for such homes have not. Of the 78 markets where tradeup home inventory has fallen over the past year, only five markets have witnessed a drop in prices. Similarly, of the 70 markets where the number of premium homes have dropped, only one – Syracuse, N.Y., – has seen a decrease in premium home prices. This is stark contrast to the 20 of 74 markets where drops in starter home inventory have occurred at a time when demand has also declined. The takeaway here is that falling inventory has been relatively more problematic for tradeup and premium home buyers over the past year, even though inventory of starter homes has dropped most.; Starter homes continue to experience the largest drops in inventory over the past year, followed closely by tradeup homes. While starter home buyers in California have seen some of the largest decreases in affordability, those in central Florida are non-California metros in the West are starting to feel their pain. But a fall in inventory for tradeup and premium homes is occurring at a time when demand for those homes is rising, so those buyers are feeling a tighter pinch than starter home buyers in markets where demand has fallen enough to keep prices from rising.; Each quarter, Trulia’s Inventory Monitor provides three metrics: (1) the number and share of inventory that are starter homes, trade-up homes, and premium homes, (2) the change in share and number of these homes, and (3) the affordability of those homes for each type of buyer. For the first edition of this report, we back-calculate inventory for each quarter back to the first quarter of 2012 through the first quarter of 2016.
We define the price cutoffs of each segment based on home value estimates of the entire housing stock, not listing price. For example, we estimate the value of each single-family home and condo and divide these estimates into three groups: the lower third we classify and starter homes, the middle third as trade-up homes, and the upper third as premium homes. We then classify a listing as a starter home on the market if its listing price falls below the price cutoff between starter and trade-up homes. This is a subtle but important difference between our inventory report and others. This is because the mix of homes on the market can change over time, and can cause large swings in the price points used to define each segment. For example, if premium homes comprise a relatively large share of homes for sale, it can make the lower third of listings look they’ve become more expensive when in fact prices in the lower third of the housing stock are unchanged.
Our national metrics are a weighted sum of listings and weighted average of affordability of the 100 largest metropolitan areas and our inventory measure is an average of snapshots taken on the first of each month of the quarter. Last, we measure affordability as the share of income needed to purchase the median priced home in each segment relative metro household income terciles. To lessen the downward skew of income of households in the lowest tercile, we estimate starter homebuyer’s income using only household incomes of homeowners within this segment."
ralph,Outlook for Housing Starts Remains Bright,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-starts-may16/,2016-06-17,"Housing starts grow solidly in May, led by continued growth in single-family units. Despite monthly volatility, the 12-month rolling total inches upwards to the 50-year average.; Despite monthly volatility, housing starts continues to be a bright spot in an otherwise supply constrained market.
Though U.S. economic expansion is maturing, the potential for growth in housing starts remains solid as starts hover around 80% of the 50-year average.
Single family builders are slowly, but surely, gaining ground on what has been a strong four years for multifamily construction.
New housing starts grew solidly in May. The 12-month rolling total of starts-which is a less volatile measure-grew 11.8% year-over-year in April to 1,154,800 starts, slightly up from April. This represents the most starts in a 12-month period since August 2007. Housing starts continue to be a bright spot in an otherwise supply constrained market, and the 12-month rolling total inches up to 80% of the 50-year average of 1,443,060 starts.

Starts of single-family units have also shown strong growth over the past year, increasing 12.9% from a 12-month rolling total of 668,200 in May 2015 to 754,500 in May 2016. The share of multifamily starts in 5+ unit buildings continues to drop from a 42-year high last year, although they grew 11.4% year-over-year. We expect the relative rise in single-family starts to continue to into the remainder of the year as single-family builders play catch-up and rent increases soften in many major markets."
ralph,Case-Shiller: San Francisco Home Price Fever Breaks – a Little,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller-april-16/,2016-05-31,"The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index suggests the U.S housing market may be stabilizing as the rate of annual price gains slowed for the second straight month in March 2016. Prices in San Francisco show noticeable cooling.; Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5.15% year-over-year in March 2016, which is the 47th consecutive month of positive gains. March is also the second straight month in which the year-over-year figure decreased over the previous month. This is a sign that the U.S. housing market is stabilizing in the wake of strong price appreciation between 2012 and 2014.
While the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is an important metric to watch, it’s worth noting that the measure is more reflective of price movements in premium homes rather than middle or lower tier homes.

Prices in last month’s three hot markets – Portland, Seattle, and Denver – continue to lead the pack with increases between 10% to 12.3%. While strong price growth in these markets should help increase inventory in the coming months, homes will be significantly less affordable for homebuyers than this time last year.

Finally, growth in San Francisco home prices continues a noticeable slowdown with year-over-year increases of 8.5%, which is the smallest annual gain since January 2015. The continued slowdown suggests the San Francisco housing market may finally be entering a phase of normalcy after years of sustained price appreciation."
ralph,Go East Young Grad: America’s Most Grad Friendly Markets,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/graduation-nation-2016/,2016-05-26,"While the West is known for its healthy economy, the East is the place to be for new college grads. In our Graduate Opportunity Index, we mash up Trulia housing market data with those from our friends at LinkedIn to find places that have the best combination of affordability, entry-level job availability, and a large share of recent grads.; New college grads take note: there’s more to a great start to your career than living in an area with high salary and strong job growth. After all, what good is that high salary if most of it is spent on rent? What happens if you can’t find a replacement job if your current one doesn’t work out? And what if there are few peers to revel with in post-college life?
To help make a difficult decision a little bit easier, we’ve partnered with LinkedIn to rate 40 of America’s strongest job markets based on what they have to offer recent college grads. Our Graduate Opportunity Index ranks metropolitan areas based on three criteria: (1) the LinkedIn New Grad Job Score, which rates metros based on the share of job openings suitable for recent college grads, (2) Trulia’s New Grad Affordability Score, which is the share of rental units considered as affordable to a new grad based on their median salary, and (3) the share of total population that is between the ages of 22 and 30 with a college degree.; While the West makes headlines with high wages and strong job growth, the East is tough to beat for new college grads looking to start their career. Of the top 10 metros offering the best perks, all are east of the Rockies and nine are either on, or east, of the Mississippi River. Pittsburgh tops our ranking because it scores high in all three components: it’s first on the LinkedIn New Grad Index, a high share (92%) of its housing stock could affordably be rented to recent college grads, and more than 5% of its population is composed of educated young persons.; Best Markets for College Grads 2016

On the West Coast, things don’t look as prosperous. Of the 10 metros that score the lowest on the Graduate Opportunity Index, nine are on or near the Pacific. The only non-western metro – Miami – had the lowest score due to few graduate jobs, only moderate affordability, and few recent college grads. Of the remaining nine, eight are in California. California dominates the worst markets for one primary reason: it doesn’t have many homes affordable for recent grads. Each California metro to bottom out the index is ranked among the ten least affordable markets. The only saving grace for new grads looking to the Golden State are an abundance of peers: California metros ranks high on the share of its population between the ages of 22 and 30 with a college degree. . Remember, even though they rank at the bottom of our overall index, these metros have strong job markets overall — including jobs for all levels of income and experience — as measured by listings. That’s how they made our list.

High Wages May Not Always Lead to the High Life
Graduates Lured by high wages in San Francisco and San Jose might want to think twice. While incomes for recent college grads in these areas are among the highest in the country, high rents will eat up much of it. Fewer than a third of homes would rent at an affordable price point, and the median rent in both of these markets come close to consuming an entire month’s paycheck. What’s more, both metros score only modestly on the share of job openings suitable for recent grads, so finding another entry-level job if you leave your existing one may be difficult.

Click here to download these data for all 40 ranked metros.; On the West Coast, things don’t look as prosperous. Of the 10 metros that score the lowest on the Graduate Opportunity Index, nine are on or near the Pacific. The only non-western metro – Miami – had the lowest score due to few graduate jobs, only moderate affordability, and few recent college grads. Of the remaining nine, eight are in California. California dominates the worst markets for one primary reason: it doesn’t have many homes affordable for recent grads. Each California metro to bottom out the index is ranked among the ten least affordable markets. The only saving grace for new grads looking to the Golden State are an abundance of peers: California metros ranks high on the share of its population between the ages of 22 and 30 with a college degree. . Remember, even though they rank at the bottom of our overall index, these metros have strong job markets overall — including jobs for all levels of income and experience — as measured by listings. That’s how they made our list.; Weakest Markets for College Grads 2016

9.1%; On the other hand, several of 10 metros with highest grad wages are also quite affordable. For example, recent grads who earn the median income of their peers would be able to afford 94% of rental units in Minneapolis, while those in Houston can afford over 91%. The other good news? Both of these markets also rank high on the LinkedIn Job Score, so moving between entry-level jobs is easy.
The Capstone
The lesson here for recent grads is that although it may be tempting to seek out places with the highest wages, doing so may not necessarily lead to a better quality of life because these areas also have high rents and a lower share of entry level jobs. Recent grads need to balance wages, rents, and job availability, so places like Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia, fit the bill. However, in places like Miami and San Francisco, not only are affordable rental units few and far between, but fewer jobs are available for the matriculated.
Methodology
Our Graduate Opportunity Index ranks 40 metropolitan areas based on three criteria: (1) the LinkedIn New Grad Job Score, which rates metros based on the share of job openings suitable for recent college grads, (2) Trulia’s New Grad Affordability Score, which is the share of rental units designated as affordable (less than 30% of monthly income) to the median income college graduate between the ages of 22 and 30, and (3) the share of total population that is between the ages of 22 and 30 with a college degree, as per 2014 American Community Survey data. Our final list of 40 metros is a result of restricting metropolitan areas to having at least 1,000 grad-level jobs and 10,000 total jobs. We combine our three metrics to create a weighted average of each metro’s ranking in each category. The weighting scheme is as follows: LinkedIn New Grad Job Score (33%), Trulia’s New Grad Affordability Score (33%), and share of total population that is between the ages of 22 and 30 with a college degree (33%). The index ranges from 0 – 1, with 1 being the best scoring and 0 being the worst."
ralph,"New Home Sales Surge, but Buyers Still Facing Shortage",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-apr-16/,2016-05-24,"New home sales surge in April, and the months’ supply of homes drops sharply.; New home sales surged in April, jumping to a seasonally adjusted rate of 619,000. This is up strongly from 531,000 in March. Even when looking at a less volatile measure-the 12-month rolling total-starts are up 10% year over year and 3% month over month. The gain reflects a sharp increase in demand from homebuyers and a healthy U.S. economy, and should put to rest fears of an oncoming recession. April’s large jump should also instill homebuilder confidence throughout the remainder of the year. Home sales in April show a sharp climb back normal, as they are now 79% of the 50-year average. This is up from 77% in March.

 
The supply of new homes also dropped sharply. The months’ supply in April decreased sharply to 4.7 months, down from 5.5 in March. A decreasing supply of new homes is sour news for homebuyers, who have also been stymied by low inventory of existing homes over the past four years. The drop in supply means sales prices for new homes may rise quickly throughout the remainder of the home buying season."

We also wanted to find out where million dollar homes have spread the most within these regions, so we calculated the value for every home in each region’s neighborhoods between May 2012 and May 2016. We define a million-dollar home as any home – regardless of whether it’s listed for sale or not – with a value of $1 million or more. Here is the breakdown of neighborhoods experiencing the largest increase within each region.
San Francisco Bay Area
Each of the three biggest Bay Area metros – San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland – have seen massive increases in the share of seven figure homes. There are over twice as many in San Francisco and San Jose, and nearly four times as many in Oakland. While the neighborhood with the largest increase over the past four years is actually in the City of San Francisco – Westwood Park – the other four of the top five are in the small suburb of San Mateo, which is sandwiched between job-rich San Jose and San Francisco.

Southern California
Each of the major Southern California housing markets – Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura County, and San Diego – have witnessed a doubling in the share of million dollar homes over the past few years. Looking at the Los Angeles-Orange County – Ventura County area, the five neighborhoods with the largest increases are all in Los Angeles County. Pacific Colony and Pacific South Bay neighborhoods in Torrance have seen the largest increase, and sit on or near the border of the ocean-side town of Redondo Beach. Emerald Isle and College Hills neighborhoods – nestled in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in Glendale – have also seen significant changes in the share of homes worth over million.

Those looking for San Diego neighborhoods with the most recent additions to the million-dollar club can either head for the hills or head for the coast. The two neighborhoods with the largest increase in million dollar homes are Bella Lago in mountainous Chula Vista and Rancho Ecncantado in the hills above Mirimar. The other three neighborhoods growing in seven figure homes are all near the coast, with Sunset Cliffs and North City sitting on or near the Pacific Ocean, and Roseville – Fleet Ridge sitting on San Diego Bay.

New York
Of the top 10 metros that had the largest increase in million dollar homes, New York actually saw the smallest relative increase, moving to 12 % of homes from 7%. But that relatively small increase was heavily concentrated in Brooklyn. Of the five neighborhoods that witnessed that great increase, all five are in Brooklyn. Bedford Stuyvesant increased the most, moving from just under 2% of homes valued at least a million dollars to 56.5%.

Honolulu
Million dollar homes in the Land of Aloha have nearly doubled since 2012, but like New York, most of the growth was concentrated in just a few areas. Each of the top 5 neighborhoods with the largest increase in Honolulu are close to majestic Diamond Head National Landmark. While the number of million-dollar home is sharply increasing in these neighborhoods, there are a few where more affordable homes are abundant, as both the Kaimuki and Hawaii Kai neighborhoods have fewer than 50% of homes over the seven figure mark.

ralph,Housing Starts Keep Rolling In April,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-housing-starts-april-16/,2016-05-17,"Housing starts grow solidly in April, led by a surge in single-family units. Despite monthly volatility, the 12-month rolling total of starts remains strong in the West and South but flat in the Northeast and Midwest.; New housing starts grew at an impressive pace in April. The 12-month rolling total of starts-which is a less volatile measure-grew 11.6% year-over-year in April to 1,148,000 starts, slightly up from March. This represents the second most starts in a 12-month period since August 2007, but is lower than March 2016. Though the continued upward trend is good news for the housing sector, the 12-month rolling total is still 20.7% below a 50-year average of 1,443,559 starts.

Starts of single-family units have also shown strong growth over the past year, increasing 13.1% from a 12-month rolling total of 662,600 in April 2015 to 749,600 in April 2016. The share of multifamily starts in 5+ unit buildings continues to drop from a 42-year high last year, although they grew 10.1% year-over-year. This downward trend of new starts in multifamily units – which tend to primarily consist of renter-occupied units – is a result of the recent surge in single-family starts rather than a drop in investment by multifamily builders. We expect the rise in the share of single-family starts to continue to into the remainder of the year as single-family builders play catch-up.

Finally, regional housing starts continue to show disparities. The South leads the country with a 12-month rolling total of 578,800 new starts, which is the best 12-month span since May 2008. The 12-month rolling total for the Midwest in April was 160,500 units. The Northeast led the country in year-over-year growth, increasing by 27.3% and growing from a 12-month rolling total of 110,400 new starts in April 2015 to 140,600 in April 2016. New starts in the West remain solid, with a 12-month total of 264,700 and year-over-year growth of 17.4%. However, the Northeast and West showed month-over-month drops of 3.5% and 2.5%, respectively.
Housing Starts Summary:
The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts in April were up 11.6% year-over-year;
The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts in single-family units in March was up 13.1% year-over-year;
The Northeast and South lead the charge in year-over-year growth."
ralph,Breaking Stride: America’s Fastest Moving Housing Markets Slowing Down,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/fast-moving-markets-spring16/,2016-05-04,"There are signs that some of the hottest markets may be slowing down, while those slow to rebound are finally heating up.; As the U.S. housing market has recovered from the Great Recession, homebuyers have been faced with declining inventory and worsening affordability. However, there are signs that some of the hottest markets on the Costly Coasts may be slowing down while slow-to-rebound markets in the Bargain Belt are finally heating up.
In this edition of Trulia’s Fastest Moving Markets Report, we not only look at how fast homes are moving off the market this home-buying season, but how those markets have changed over the past year. We found that:
Nationally, homes are moving off the market faster than last year: 66.6% of homes are still on the market after 30 days, which is down slightly from 67.8% from the same period a year ago. About 63.4% starter homes and 59.8% of trade-up homes are still on the market after a month, which is 2.1 and 3.1 percentage points faster than last year.
Homes are moving fastest in San Jose and Oakland, but moving slowest in Fairfield County and Long Island, N.Y. Metros east of the Mississippi have sped up the most, while many to the west have slowed. Houston, a city where the economy has been hit by lower oil prices, has slowed the most, but homes are moving much faster than last year in Colorado Springs, Colo.
Inventory matters: Markets such as Colorado Springs that have experienced the biggest drop in available homes for sale during the past year are seeing more homes moving faster.
Home Moving Slightly Faster Than Last Year, Trade-up Homes See Largest Jump
Nationally, 66.6% of the homes listed for sale on March 6 were still on the market on April 6, which is down from 67.8% for the same period last year. However, not all segments of the market move alike: fluctuations in inventory – which affects the time that homes stay on the market – can behave quite differently within different price points (starter, trade-up homes, etc.).
To see how quickly homes are moving by segment, we evenly divided all homes in each of the 100 largest U.S. metros into three price tiers and gave each metro its own price cutoffs based on what’s considered high-end, mid-range, and low-end – what we call premium homes, trade-up homes, and starter homes, respectively. We then counted the share of each that was still on the market after one month.

The bad news for first-time homebuyers is that the pace at which starter and trade-up homes are moving has quickened much more than premium homes. Last year, 65.5% of starter homes were still on the market after a month, compared with 63.4% this year. Trade-up homes are moving even faster, moving from 62.9% still on the market last year to 59.8% this year. On the other hand, premium homes have barely budged, having increased slightly to 71.5% from 71.8%. Much of this is likely due to the fact over the past few years, inventory of both starter and trade-up homes have fallen much more than premium homes. However, the national trend hides big differences from one local market to another. In some metros, the sales pace is quickening, while slowing in others.
Homes Coming off Market Much Slower in Bay Area, Houston 
The San Francisco Bay Area still reigns as the region with the fastest moving markets, with San Jose, Oakland, and San Francisco topping the list. In fact, less than 42% of the homes for sale in these three metros remained on the market after one month. But there is consolatory news for homebuyers in the Bay Area: the the pace at which homes are coming off the market is slowing.

In fact, San Francisco is second and Oakland eighth on the list of metros with the biggest slowdown over the past year. In April 2015, about 35.5% of homes in San Francisco were still on the market after month. Today, that number increased by nearly six percentage points to 41.3%. Just across the Bay, Oakland dropped 4 percentage points to 39.8% from 35.8%.

However, the slowdown in the Bay Area was eclipsed by the massive slowdown in Houston, which experienced a drop to 66.2% of homes on the market after a month last year to 50% this year. What’s causing this? Falling oil prices are a big factor. In fact, the sustained drop in oil prices hasn’t just hit Houston. Four of the five metros with largest share of employment in oil and natural gas extraction have also seen a slowdown. The share of homes still on the market after one month in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, and Forth Worth, Texas, has increased – albeit modestly – between 1.6 and 2.3% points. And Bakersfield, Calif. – which has the nation’s largest share of employment in the oil industry – was flat year-over-year.
Collectively, the five largest oil towns in the U.S. slowed down 9.6% points over the past year, while the 95 non-oil towns saw a slight pickup year-over-year by 1.8%. Most of the collective slowdown in oil towns was due to the massive slowdown in Houston, rather than a systematic causation between oil and housing. This is due to the fact that even in metros with the largest share of employment in oil-related industries, the share is no more 6.3% – a relatively small amount that may not be enough to have major effects on local housing markets.

Homebuyers Can Take Their Time East of the Mississippi, But Need to Move Faster
 While homebuyers in the West need to move the fastest, those east of the Mississippi don’t need to rush. Seven of the 10 slowest moving markets are there. Households wanting to take their time in the home-buying process can do well on either side of Long Island Sound. Fairfield County, Conn., and Long Island, N.Y. are the two slowest moving markets in the U.S., where 78% and 76.9% of homes are still on the market after one month, respectively. Homebuyers won’t also have to go far west of the Mississippi River to find the other three non-Eastern metros that are moving slowest: include Tulsa, Little Rock, Ark., and El Paso, Texas, where no fewer than 75% of homes are still on the market after a month.

Although homes move slowest East of the Mississippi, they are moving much faster than last year. Of the top 10 markets that have seen the largest pickup in the pace to which homes move off the market, eight are East of the Mississippi River. Long Island, N.Y. – the second slowest moving market – has sped up the most over the past year, moving from 88.6% of homes on the market after one-month last year to 76.9% this year. The only two markets west of the Mississippi to see the largest pickup are Colorado Springs and Kansas City, Mo. The South also has large representation in the markets with the biggest pickup, with Charlotte, N.C., Louisville, K.Y., Atlanta, and Raleigh, N.C., making the list. The only market west of the Rockies to come close is Portland, Ore., which ranked 16th and experienced a pickup of 5.4 percentage points.

So what drove the speed of markets during the past year? Inventory. While other factors – such as employment growth, wage growth, and population growth all play a role – changes in inventory are strongly correlated with changes in how long homes are staying on the market.

Of the 100 largest U.S. metros, those with larger drops in inventory over the past year have seen more homes moving off the market after a month. For example, Colorado Springs has experienced a 35.7% decrease in inventory over the past year while the share of homes still on the market after a month fell 8.8 percentage point from 62.% in 2015 to 53.2% in 2016.. On the other hand, Sarasota, Fla. has seen a noticeable slowdown in home coming off the market after 30 days while also seeing a relatively large year-over increases of inventory.
 
All and all, this offers both good news and bad news for homebuyers. Homes are moving off the market slightly faster this year than last at the national level, but there are dramatic differences across individual markets. Home hunters East of Mississippi can still take their time but will need to move slightly faster than they did last year. Meanwhile those in the West won’t need to move as frantically as they did last year, but they will still need to move quick to get their dream home.
Methodology
To find out how long homes are staying on the market, we calculated the share of homes for sale on Trulia over a one-month period. We first looked at homes listed on March 7, then counted how many were still for sale on April 7. Faster-moving markets had a lower percentage of homes still on the market after two months, while slower-moving markets had a higher percentage.
Our one-month measure is similar to a common housing statistic: days on market (DOM). In general, housing markets with more inventory and fewer buyers will have a higher share of for-sale homes remaining on the market after one month and a higher median DOM. But we prefer our one-month measure over the widely watched DOM as a way to determine how quickly homes are moving in a market. Why? We think DOM is potentially misleading. If lots of new inventory suddenly lands on the market, then median DOM could fall thanks to all those newly listed homes. Thus, a low median DOM might indicate that buyers are snapping up homes quickly, so homes aren’t staying on the market long (a seller’s market). But it could also signal that a lot of new inventory has just come onto the market (a buyer’s market). As a result, it’s difficult to decipher what’s really going on based on DOM alone."
ralph,Homeownership Rate Ebbs For All But Gen X,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/homeownership-vacancy-survey-march-16/,2016-04-28,"Today’s release of the Census Homeownership and Vacancy Survey shows that the homeownership rate continued to drop in 2016 Q1. However, it was the second straight quarter of year-over-year gains in the homeownership rate for Gen X'ers.; Today’s Census Homeownership and Vacancy Survey release provides optimism that the homeownership rate hit is flattening. The Census’ seasonally adjusted homeownership rate in the first quarter decreased slightly to 63.5% from 63.7%, but the change is not significantly different from a year ago.

Of particular note was the continued increase in the homeownership rate for Gen X. Households aged 35-44 increased their homeownership rate a full 0.5 points, moving to 58.9% to 58.4%. This is the second straight quarter of year-over-year increases. This is important as many Gen Xers lost their homes during the recession, so this is a cautiously optimistic sign that we may be seeing boomerang buyers coming back into homeownership. Although this year-over-year change is not statistically significant, the 0.5 point increase is just at the upper bound of an error rate of 0.5 percent.
Existing Home Sales and Homeownership Highlights:
The ownership rate dropped slightly to 63.5% from 63.7% a year earlier, but was not a significant drop.
The ownership rate climbed for the second straight quarter for Gen X, moving upwards by 0.5 points."
ralph,U.S housing Market May Be Stabilizing As Home Price Growth Slows,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller-feb-2016/,2016-04-26,"The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index suggests the U.S housing market may be stabilizing as the rate of annual price growth slowed slightly in February of 2016. Coastal markets in the West and South led the charge.
Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5.3% year-over-year in February 2016, which is the 46th consecutive month of positive gains. February also breaks a 10-month streak where ninth in which the year-over-year figure increased over the previous month. While one month does not make a trend, this is a sign that the US housing market may be stabilizing in the wake of strong price appreciation between 2012 and 2014. While the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is an important metric to watch, it’s worth noting that the measure is more reflective of price movements in premium homes rather than middle or lower tier homes.

Prices in last month’s three hot markets – Seattle, San Francisco, and Portland – continue to surge year-over-year with increases of between 9.2% to 11%. However, this month Denver replaces San Francisco in the top three with an increase of 9.7% Higher prices in these markets should help increase inventory headed this Spring, but at the same time push some homes out of reach for buyers. Prices in the coastal West, Southwest, and coastal South led the way with year-over-year averages of 9.1%, 7.8%, and 6.1%, but price increases in the cities are down slightly from the end of 2015. Prices in the Midwest and coastal North lagged, showing smaller gains of 4% and 2.4%. This suggests the price gap between coastal, temperate regions of the country and more inland, northeasterly markets is remaining flat.

S&P/Case-Shiller Highlights: 
The US National index for February 2016 was up 5.3% year-over-year.
The three cities with the largest year-over-year gains were Portland, Seattle, and Denver, with gains of 11.9%, 11%, and 9.7%

ralph,"New Home Sales Steady, but Inventory Gap Is Too",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new_home_sales_march_16/,2016-04-25,"While New home sales in March were down month-over-month, the 12-month rolling total continues to looks solid. The share of new homes purchased that haven't started construction sits near a 10-year high, likely reflecting the lack of existing home inventory.; New home sales in March were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 511,000, which is down 1.5% month-over-month but up 5.14% year-over-year. The month-over-month drop is due more to last month’s upward revision to 519,000 from 512,000 than a fundamental change in demand for new homes. In addition, new home sales numbers from the U.S. Census are extremely volatile: the margin of error is wide and often includes zero, which means we can’t be certain whether these month-over-month or year-over-year changes actually increased, decreased, or stayed flat.
A better number to look at is the 12-month rolling total, which is up 8.9% year-over-year but flat month-over-month. This reflects a steady increase in demand from homebuyers as well as increasing confidence of homebuilders. That said, there are two caveats on the upside. First, the year-over-year increase is down from 9.7% last month. Second, still remain about 24% below the 50-year average.

Last, the share of new home sales bought off a plan continues to hover near a 10-year high of 32%. Persistently low inventory of existing homes is making it difficult for homebuyers to find properties to buy, and pushes prospective buyers away from existing homes towards new homes. This allows builders to sell more new homes that haven’t yet been built.

New Home Sales Summary:
New home sales in March were up 5.4% year-over-year, and down5% month-over-month, but both of these numbers aren’t statistically significant.
The 12-month rolling total of new home sales was solid: March 2016 totals were up 8.9% but flat month-over-month.
The share of new home sales purchased off a plan continues to hover near a 10-year high of 32%."
ralph,Best Places For Retirees To Rent Or Buy,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/rentvsbuy_retirees_spring16/,2016-04-21,"Buying a retirement home is almost always cheaper than renting one, and traditional retirement communities offer some of the best deals. But the math changes substantially if retirees don't care to leave an inheritance.; In our last Rent vs. Buy Report, we looked at whether it is cheaper for millennials to buy a home than rent. In most cases, it was. But what about those looking to buy their retirement home? For this edition, we take a look at the whether it is cheaper for retirees to rent or buy in their golden years and found that:
Nationally, buying is slightly cheaper than renting compared to last year. For all households (retiring or not) who move every seven years and can afford to put 20% down, it’s 34.8% cheaper to buy – becoming slightly cheaper from 34.2% last year. Locally, buying ranges from being 52.3% cheaper than renting in New Orleans versus just 14.4% cheaper in Honolulu.
For retirees, buying is cheaper than renting in all major metros by 41.8% At the city level, Florida offers the best deals on purchasing a home over renting, and popular retirement communities such as Sun City, Ariz., and The Villages, Fla., offer some of the widest margins.
Does renting ever make more sense for retirees? Buying in retirement is only better than renting if retirees care about leaving inheritance. If retired households don’t care about the equity in their home at the end of their life, renting a home is better option in 98 of the 100 cities with the most retirees. This is because the value of the equity in a home is a significant contributor to the financial benefits of homeownership. If we leave out this value because retirees don’t care about it, the benefits of homeownership compared to renting fall.
Buying Slightly Cheaper than Last Year
Trulia’s biannual Rent vs. Buy Report assumes a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with a 20% down payment and 25% tax bracket for households moving every seven years. With these assumptions, buying is 34.8% cheaper than renting on a national basis, based on March home values and rents. That’s slightly better than a year ago, when buying was about 34.2% cheaper. Why? Interest rates dropped a bit year-over-year to 3.86% from about 3.89%, which makes it slightly less expensive to take out a mortgage.
Those trying to decide whether to buy or rent a home this spring will have the easiest decision in the South. Eight of the 10 metros that offer the largest financial advantage of homeownership are there, with Philadelphia and Detroit being the only non-Southern market to make the list. Buying a home in the Big Easy will be the easiest on your wallet: after seven years of homeownership, buying a home is 52.3% cheaper in New Orleans than renting. Buying a home up the road in Baton Rouge, La., isn’t a bad deal either, where homeownership is 51.3% cheaper.

Potential homebuyers in the West and Northeast have a more difficult decision to make, although it’s still significantly cheaper to buy than rent. Seven of the 10 metros that offer the largest financial advantage of homeownership are in California, with Honolulu, New York, and Newark, N.J., the only non-Golden State markets where the margin is smallest. The financial advantage of homeownership is narrowest in Honolulu, but still 14.4% cheaper over seven years with 20% down. In San Jose, Calif., the margin is just 15.7%. Those considering buying a home in the other eight metros where the financial advantage is narrowest should fear not: it is at least 21% cheaper to buy a home than rent one.

Looking for a Retirement Home That’s Cheaper to Buy? Head to the Sunshine State
When it comes to the rent vs. buy math, retirees are different. Using 2014 American Community Survey Data, we found that those aged 65 and over tend to move about every 15 years* instead of seven, and over half would fall into the 15% federal tax bracket** instead of 25%. With those assumptions, buying is 41.8% cheaper than renting nationally. Even in metros with the slimmest margin, such as Honolulu, buying the median valued home is at least 27% cheaper than renting it. In New Orleans, the margin is 58.1%.
However, retirees may be looking to compare the costs of buying in specific cities, rather than metropolitan areas. As one heads into retirement, metro wide factors – such as commute times, employment prospects, or proximity to good schools – might become less important, while city-level factors – such as proximity to other retired households – might become more so.
 

To help shed light on which cities might offer the best financial advantages of homeownership in retirement, we ran the numbers for the 100 U.S. cities with the largest share of residents aged 65 and older. It’s cheaper to buy a retirement home in each one of these cities than to rent one. However, the gap ranges from 71.6% cheaper in The Villages, Fla. to just 18.7% cheaper in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., And there’s even better news for those looking to retiree under the sun: each of the 10 cities that offer the largest financial advantage of homeownership are in the Sunshine State.

If You Don’t Have, Or Like Your Heirs, Renting Might Be the Better Choice in Retirement
Our rent vs. buy equation takes into account the value of the equity in your home when you sell, which is important if you need to buy another home. The grim reality for most retirees is that their retirement home will likely be last home they’ll purchase, so any remaining equity in the house will be passed on to heirs. But what if you don’t have any, or don’t care to pass on anything to the ones you do have?
When we omit the value of home equity in our rent vs. model, it’s actually more expensive to buy a retirement home than rent one in 98 of the 100 cities with the largest 65+ populations. The only two cities where it’s cheaper to buy are the The Villages, Fla. and Danville, Va., where it’s 14% and 7.1% cheaper, respectively.
To recap, it is slightly cheaper to buy than rent this year compared to last, which is mostly due to a small drop in mortgage rates. Potential homebuyers in the South have a much easier decision to make than those in the West. For retirees, the decision is even easier, regardless of which city they looking to retire in. But for those old-timers who aren’t concerned about leaving anything to the youngin’s, renting is the cheaper option in their golden years. 
Rent vs. Buy Methodology
Trulia calculates the costs of buying and renting by:
We use our quality-adjusted measure of home prices and rents, which allows an apples-to-apples comparison between rental and owner-occupied housing units. We looked at median home value and rent in March 2016 in each of the largest 100 metros.
We calculate the initial total monthly costs of owning and renting, including mortgage payments, maintenance, insurance, and taxes.
We calculate the future total monthly costs of owning and renting, taking into account expected price and rent appreciation, as well as projected inflation.
We factor in one-time costs and proceeds, including closing costs, down payment, sale proceeds, and security deposits.
We calculate net present value, which reveals the opportunity cost of using money to buy a house instead of investing it. Net present value is the worth in today’s dollars of a future stream of payments and proceeds, taking into account expected interest rates.
Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy Calculator lets you compare renting and buying costs using other assumptions about prices, rents, and other factors. It uses the same math that powers this report. You can read our extended methodology here.
Mortgage rates are from the Mortgage Bankers Association, April 1.
(*) 2014 American Community Survey Data shows that Americans aged 65 or older move approximately every 15 years.

ralph,Existing Home Sales Pick Up From February Stall,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/existing-home-sales-march-16/,2016-04-20,"March existing home sales rebound strongly from a disappointing February, but annual growth is nearing a two-year low. The number of sales per real estate job is up slightly, but still well below pre-recession highs.; Existing home sales increased 5.1% in March to an annual rate of 5,330,000, but the increase was not enough to make up for the 7.3% drop in February. In addition, sales are up just 1.5% from this time last year, suggesting that low inventory of homes for sale continues to dampen both real estate agents’ and homebuyers’ ability to find homes in the face of solid economic growth. If we discount the large drop in November 2015 home sales because of new disclosure rules introduced last year, March’s year-over-year increase was the smallest annual increase since September 2014.

Low inventory has also dampened the number of existing sales per real estate sector employee. Despite job growth in the real estate services sector remaining higher than the pace of national job growth in March, at around 2.3%, the number of existing homes sales per employee in March stood at 3.5. This is up slightly from the previous month but flat from a year earlier. While the number of sales per real estate employee hovers near post-recession highs, March’s number of 3.5 remains well below pre-recession peaks of approximately 5 sales per employee per month.

Existing Home Sales Highlights:
Existing home sales in December were up 1.5% year-over-year, and 5.1% month-over-month.
Annual gains in existing home sales were the smallest since September 2014.
The number of real estate jobs per home sale is up slightly from February, but still well below pre-recession highs."

Although multifamily starts have led the way, the share single-family new starts is beginning to rebound from a 40-year low as multifamily hits a plateau. The number of jobs per new housing starts is rebounding.; New housing starts grew at an impressive pace in March. The 12-month rolling total of starts-which is a more statistically robust measure of trends in housing start data-grew 13% year-over-year in March to 1,143,000 starts. This represents the most starts in a 12-month period since August 2007. Though the continued upward trend is good news for the housing sector, the 12-month rolling total is still 21% below a 50-year average of 1,444,085 starts. This is unchanged from the 50-year average in February.

Starts of single-family units have also shown strong growth over the past year, increasing 14.1% from a 12-month rolling total of 653,900 in March 2015 to 746,000 in March 2016. The share in multifamily starts in 5+ unit buildings continues to drop from a 42-year high last year. This downward trend of new starts in multifamily units ­ which tend to primarily consist of renter-occupied units ­ is a result of the recent surge in single-family starts rather than a drop in investment by multifamily builders. We expect a rise in the share of single-family starts to continue to into the remainder of the year.
March’s employment report showed that it was the best month for residential construction jobs since November 2008. In addition, the number of jobs per housing start kicked up to 2.4, which matches the 15-year average and the largest number in nearly a year. This is due to the recent increase in single-family starts, which uses more workers per unit built than multifamily starts. As the share of multifamily starts decreases, we should expect this numer to increase in the months ahead as more labor intensive single-family starts to pick up.

Housing Starts Summary:
The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts in March were up 13% year-over-year;
The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts in single-family units in March was up 14.1% year-over-year;
The number of construction jobs per start has hit the 15-year average."
ralph,"Job Growth Strong But Slowing, Sales Down for Real Estate Ranks",Housing Policy,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/jobs_report_feb16/,2016-04-01,"U.S. job growth in March was solid but pulled back slightly from a strong February. While job numbers remain strong, the rate of job growth in 2016 appears to be slowing compared to last year. In the real estate services sector, low inventory is stifling the number of existing homes sales per employee compared to pre-recession times.; Job growth in March pulled back slightly from a strong February, adding 215,000 jobs, or 2%, year-over-year. This is down from the revised increase of 245,000 in February, but was the 73rd consecutive month of gains. Wages posted another strong annual increase, with average hourly earnings growing by 2.3% year-over-year, likely due to continued tightening of the labor market.

Despite the solid March job numbers, the year-over-year job growth rate continues to slow from a post-recession high of 2.3% in February of 2015. While strong, the January to March 2016 job gains are failing keep up with the year-over-over gains seen at this time last year. This slowing growth reflects a maturing economic cycle. However, the impacts of slowing job growth on the housing market may be negligible in the short-run, given historically tight inventory.

While job growth in the real estate services sector remains slightly higher than the pace of national job growth, at around 2.3%, the number of existing homes sales per employee in February is showing recent volatililty at 3.3, falling from 3.5 sales per employee in January but up from 3.2 in November (note that February is the most recent existing home sales release from the National Association of Realtors). This recent volatility was likely a result of closing-delays from new lending regulations. While the number of sales per real estate employee hovers near post-recession highs, Feburary’s number of 3.3 remains well below pre-recession highs of approximately 5 sales per employee per month. The relatively low number of sales per real estate employee is likely due to the sharp drop in existing inventory over the past four years.
Existing Home Sales and Homeownership Highlights:
Payrolls increased by 215,000 jobs, or 2%, year-over-year.
Average hourly earning increased by 2.3% year-over-year.
Job growth in the real estate sector continues grew at 2.3% year-over-year, but home sales per real estate employee remains low."

Multifamily starts leads the way, and as a share of new starts hovers around a 42-year high. Starts in the South lead the country, but have grown most in the Northeast.; New housing starts continue to grow strongly. The 12-month rolling total of starts ­ which is a more statistically robust measure of trends in housing start data ­ grew 11.9% year-over-year in February to 1,131,400 starts.

Multifamily starts in 5+ unit buildings continue to hover around a 42-year high, but has shown recent signs of a downward trend as a share of all new starts. This slight downward trend of new starts in multifamily units ­ which tend to primarily consist of renter occupied units ­ is likely a result of an increase in single-family starts as well rather than a drop in investment by multifamily builders. The share appears to be continuing into a plateau phase, so we expect the rise in multifamily starts to continue to flatten during the remainder of the year.
Finally, regional housing starts continue to show disparities. The South leads the country with a 12-month rolling total of 567,700 new starts, which is the best 12-month span since June 2008. The 12-month rolling total for the Midwest in February was 156,100 units. The Northeast led the country in year-over-year growth, increasing by 33.8% and growing from a 12-month rolling total of 106,200 new starts in February 2015 to 142,100 in February 2016. New starts in the West remain solid, with a 12-month total of 266,500 and year-over-year growth of 13.6%. The disparity between the Midwest and other regions mirrors relatively slower economic growth in Midwestern markets and continued expansion in the South and West.

Housing Starts Summary:
The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts in February were up 11.9% year-over-year;
The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts in 5+ units in January was up 12.4% year-over-year, and makes up over a third of new starts.

ralph,House Arrest: How Low Inventory Is Slowing Home Buying,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/inventory-price-watch-q116/,2016-03-21,"Nationally, the number and share of starter and trade-up homes on the market has decreased over the past four years. We find increases of premium home prices are strongly correlated with a drop in the number of trade-up homes on the market, while a larger share of homes owned by investors is likely affecting the supply of starter homes.; America is experiencing a housing shortage. Not only are there fewer homes available to buyers of all income levels, those just starting out or making their first foray into home ownership are worse off than they’ve been in years. There are fewer homes available, an even if they can find a home, it’s likely to be more expensive.
Compared to other inventory reports, the Trulia Inventory and Price Watch is a new quarterly report that offers buyers and sellers deeper insight into the supply and affordability of homes within different segments: starter homes, trade-up homes, and premium homes.
Home seekers need information not just about total inventory, but also about inventory in the segment they are interested in buying. For example, changes in total inventory or median affordability don’t provide first-time buyers useful information about what’s happening with starter homes. In addition, there is also a strong relationship between inventory and affordability in the three segments, so it’s important to track segment changes because that change is likely to induce change inventory and affordability in other segments.
Looking at all the housing stock nationally and in the 100 largest U.S. metros from January 1, 2012 to March 1, 2016, we found:
Nationally, inventory has dropped most for starter and trade-up homes, but less so for premium homes;
Regionally, starter home inventory is down most in the West and South. Starter home affordability is down most in California;
Rising prices is causing homebuyer gridlock. The growing price spread between premium homes and trade-up homes in some markets is highly correlated with fewer trade-up homes coming onto market.
Nationally, Starter and Trade-Up Home Inventory Down More Than 40% Since 2012
Heading into the spring house-hunting season, inventory remains tight and affordability is worsening, especially for starter-home buyers. Over the past four years:
The number of starter homes on the market dropped by 43.6%, while the share of starter homes dropped from 30.2% to 27.7%. Starter homebuyers today will need to shell out 5.6% more of their income — based on the median income of start-up buyers — towards a home purchase than in 2012;
The number of trade-up homes on the market decreased by 41%, while the share of trade-up homes dropped from 27.2% to 26.1%. Trade-up homebuyers today will need to pay 2.6% more of their income for a home than in 2012;
The number of premium homes on the market decreased by 33.4%, while the share of premium homes increased from 42.7% to 46.2%. Premium homebuyers today will need to spend 1.4% more of their income for a home than in 2012.

*Needed to buy median price home in segment


Low inventory is taking a toll on the affordability of all home segments, but especially starter homes. At the bottom of the housing market in 2012, starter homes were nearly affordable, primarily because starter prices were discounted: homebuyers needed only to shell out 32.2% of their income to buy the median priced starter home. Now, starter homebuyers would need to dedicate 37.7% of their income – a 5.6 percentage point increase. This is significantly more than the 2.6 and 1.4 percentage point increase in income that trade-up and premium homebuyers need to spend, respectively.
Why is inventory so low, especially for starter and trade-up homes? Three reasons: First, investors bought many of the foreclosed homes during the recession and turned into rentals. Second, a larger share of lower-priced are homes are still underwater compared to premium homes, which means that these homeowners are unlikely to sell and take a loss. Third, and most importantly, rising prices are creating homebuyer gridlock. In other words, the spread of homes prices, specifically the growing difference between premium homes prices and trade-up home prices, is likely causing a decrease in trade-up home inventory.
Why does the premium price spread matter? The more premium home prices rise, the more difficult it is for trade-up homeowners to find a premium home that fits their budget. And if trade-up homeowners can’t find a home that fits their budget, they are less likely to sell their existing home. In fact, there is a strong correlation between growth in the premium home price gap and a drop in the inventory of trade-up homes. In other words, housing segments are intertwined. The more premium prices rise, the less likely existing trade-up homeowners will put their home on the market.
 
For Starter Homebuyers, Wrangling a Home out West is Tough
Across the 100 largest metros, 95 have shown a decrease in the number of starter homes over the past four years. Of the 10 metros that have seen the largest drop, all are in the West and South. The number of starter homes in Salt Lake City has dropped the most, from 1,243 to just 151 – an 88% drop in four years.

Starter Home Affordability Worsens in California
The list of metros with the largest decrease in starter home affordability – which is affected by both the number of listings and home-buying demand – looks rather different. Nine of the 10 metros experiencing the largest drop in affordability are located in the Golden State. For instance, starter-home buyers in Oakland, Calif., would have to spend nearly 70% of their income to afford a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage on a starter home, which is 29% more of their income than in 2012.
The cause of this sharp drop in California’s starter-home inventory: demand for starter homes remains high because of strong job growth. Faced with growing demand and tight supply, prices of all homes in California have risen sharply over the past few years. And as prices rise, homebuyers tend to follow the principles of supply and demand.
This means buyers must settle for smaller, less expensive homes than they might otherwise buy elsewhere. Some of this substitution effect could play out in the form of homebuyers increasingly looking down the housing ladder – those who might normally buy trade-up homes might actually be looking at buying smaller, less expensive homes that fall into the starter home category, inflating prices past the affordability points for true starter-home buyers.

Prospective first-time and trade-up homebuyers should consider that if the inventory of homes for sale continues to drop, finding a home will remain difficult. They likely will be faced with more competition for the few homes that are on the market, which can lead to bidding wars and homes selling higher than asking price. Sellers are in an increasingly better position to sell their home than in years past, but may have trouble finding another home to buy. Ultimately, premium home buyers will have a much better shot at finding a home, since over 46% of the listings in the last three months were in this segment.
 
Methodology
Each quarter, Trulia’s Inventory Monitor provides three metrics: (1) the number and share of inventory that are starter homes, trade-up homes, and premium homes, (2) the change in share and number of these homes, and (3) the affordability of those homes for each type of buyer. For the first edition of this report, we back-calculate inventory for each quarter back to the first quarter of 2012 through the first quarter of 2016.
We define the price cutoffs of each segment based on home value estimates of the entire housing stock, not listing price. For example, we estimate the value of each single-family home and condo and divide these estimates into three groups: the lower third we classify and starter homes, the middle third as trade-up homes, and the upper third as premium homes. We then classify a listing as a starter home on the market if its listing price falls below the price cutoff between starter and trade-up homes. This is a subtle but important difference between our inventory report and others. This is because the mix of homes on the market can change over time, and can cause large swings in the price points used to define each segment. For example, if premium homes comprise a relatively large share of homes for sale, it can make the lower third of listings look they’ve become more expensive when in fact prices in the lower third of the housing stock are unchanged.
Our national metrics are a weighted sum of listings and weighted average of affordability of the 100 largest metropolitan areas and our inventory measure is an average of snapshots taken on the first of each month of the quarter. Last, we measure affordability as the share of income needed to purchase the median priced home in each segment relative metro household income terciles. To lessen the downward skew of income of households in the lowest tercile, we estimate starter homebuyer’s income using only household incomes of homeowners within this segment."

ralph,America’s Best Neighborhoods For Living Well,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/best-neighborhoods/,2016-03-10,"Today Trulia released the new Live Well maps to help home seekers to find the best places to live for staying active and healthy. Using data that power these maps, we've discovered that neighborhoods in Charlottesville, Va., San Francisco, and San Diego top the list for living a healthy lifestyle.; Neighborhoods are where the fun is. Where a home is matters just as much, if not more than floor plans, updated kitchens and square footage. With that in mind, Trulia’s geospatial and economics teams worked together to show home seekers where they can find amenities that will help them stay active and healthy. We’ve not only launched a new set of interactive maps that illustrate where you can find Quiet Streets, Great Places to Play, as well as Care and Essentials, we’ve created a Live Well Index that ranks neighborhoods across the country according to the abundance of such features.
Putting it all together, we found:
The best neighborhoods for living well in small metros (population less than 1 million people) are in Charlottesville, VA, and Cedar Rapids, IA;
The best neighborhoods for living well in midsized metros (population between 1 and 2 million people) are in San Francisco, CA and New Orleans, LA;
The best neighborhoods for living well in large metros (population more than 2 million people) are in San Diego, and Los Angeles.
How do we measure living well? We use data from our three Live Well maps to construct a Live Well Index, which ranks each neighborhood by:
Quiet Streets: the share of all streets within a neighborhood with low traffic;
Great Places to Play: the number of play-centric amenities, such as parks, trails, indoor bounce houses, among other like facilities; 
Care and Essentials: the number of hospitals and care facilities like urgent care clinics, pediatricians, pharmacies, and day care locations.
Not all neighborhoods are alike: some are large, some are small, some have a lot of people, and some have none. To make sure these differences don’t bias our index, we only look at neighborhoods that are between one and two square miles in area – neighborhoods large enough to have a decent number of live well features but small enough to actually feel like a neighborhood. Without further adieu, here are the best neighborhoods for living well in the U.S.
Living Well in Small Cities
Those looking to live well in a small city would be best off in the Locust Grove neighborhood of Charlottesville, Va. Locust Grove sits just north of downtown Charlottesville, and boasts a high concentration of play-centric amenities such as the Meadow Creek golf course and numerous playgrounds. It’s also nestled between three large parks and is quiet – over half of it’s streets have low traffic volume. Another added bonus: It’s close, but not too close, to the University of Virginia, which is full of restaurants, bars, and bookstores.

Other small-city neighborhoods making the list include Noelridge Park in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which is home to a large number of play-centric amenities and trails, and Burns Park in Ann Arbor, Mich., which has great access to health care facilities due to its proximity to the University of Michigan. Future Wolverines take note: residents of Burns Park pay the biggest premium to live there at $267 per square foot – the highest price tag amongst our five best small-city neighborhoods.

Living Well in Midsized Cities
The best neighborhood for living well in midsized cities is the Outer Sunset in San Francisco. Living well is easy in the Outer Sunset because it lies between three great urban amenities: Ocean Beach to the West, Golden Gate Park to the North, and the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center to the East. However, to no surprise living well in the Outer Sunset is costly – a whopping $623 per square foot, which also makes it the priciest neighborhood in midsized cities.

Looking for a better deal? Head to the bayou. Living well in the Big Easy is easy and cheap: the West Riverside neighborhood of New Orleans comes in second because of it’s proximity to Audubon Park, the Children’s Hospital of New Orleans, and the banks of the Mississippi River. And it’s a bargain compared to the Outer Sunset, at just $266 per square foot. Other neighborhoods in midsized cities that make the list are Crestivew in Austin, Texas, Driftwood in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., (in the city of Hollywood), and Riverwest, along the Milwaukee River in Wisconsin.

Living Well in Large Cities
For big-city folks looking to live well, Southern California is the place to be. Four of the top five neighborhoods scoring highest on our live well index are in the Southland. Sunny Ocean Beach in San Diego is an urban hiker’s paradise. Sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean, Mission Bay, and Point Loma, it boasts a lengthy network of trails and footpaths, and also a number of surf shops, skate parks, and volleyball courts to help residents live the beach lifestyle.

It’s neighbor to the north – Plaza in Long Beach – comes in second on our list, and also ranks high because of it’s proximity to play-centric amenities. Plaza sits next to El Dorado Park, which is home to a golf course, tennis academy, and archery range, as well as several miles of footpaths. Other neighborhoods that make the large city list include Beverly Center in Los Angeles, Sunpark in Santa Monica – which is the priciest of large cities neighborhoods at $752 per square foot – and Sunset Hill in Seattle.

Make no mistake: there are plenty of fantastic neighborhoods in the U.S. for living well that don’t make our list. This is because many neighborhoods perform well in one category but not in another. For example, Ala Moana in Honolulu is the best small-city neighborhood for play, given its large number of outdoor shops and recreation services. But it ranks low in the share of quiet streets because it’s near high traffic Waikiki Beach, which depresses Ala Moana’s overall ranking. But don’t take our word for it: check out our new Live Well maps yourself to find a neighborhood that’s best for living a healthy lifestyle.
Methodology
To find out where the best Live Well neighborhoods are in America, we cranked through the neighborhood amenities data on our site and created a ranking based on four metrics in three categories: quiet streets on Trulia (low volume street segments), great places to play (open street map trails and Yelp play-centric amenities), and care and essentials (health-care related Yelp amenities). 
Our quiet streets data is generated from a proprietary algorithm that estimates traffic volumes on a given road segment based on how “central” that segment is relative to other roads in that neighborhood, and is classified into five levels of estimated traffic volume. We classify a quiet street as one that falls within the bottom quintile.
Second, we use data from the “Active” and “Health Care” Yelp categories to find the location of play-centric and health-centric amenities, which includes places and services such as playgrounds, golf courses, hospitals, and pediatricians. 
 
Last, we combine these to create a weighted average of each neighborhood’s ranking in each category. The weighting scheme is as follows: quiet streets (33%), great places to play (16.5% trails and 16.5% play-centric), and care and essentials (33%). The index ranges from 0 – 100, with 100 being the best scoring and 0 being the worst. 
 
Finally, we define small metros as those with less a population of less than one million, medium metros as those with a population of between one and two million, and large metros as those with a population of greater than 2 million."
ralph,"New Home Sales Remain Strong, Inventory Shrinking",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-jan-16/,2016-02-24,"New home sales in January start off weak, but the 12-month rolling total looks solid. The share of new homes purchased that haven't started construction sits near a 10-year high, likely reflecting a fall in inventory of existing homes.; New home sales in January start off the year strong at a seasonally adjusted rate of 494,000, which is down 9.2% month-over-month and 5.2% year-over-year. However, all new home sales numbers from the U.S. Census are extremely volatile: the margin of error is wide and often includes zero, which means we can’t be certain whether the month-over-month or year-over-year changes actually increased, decreased, or stayed flat.
A better number to look at is the 12-year rolling total, which is up 11.9% year-over-year but down 0.4% month-over-month. This reflects a slow but steady increase in demand from homebuyers as well as increasing confidence of homebuilders. It also a positive sign for the U.S. economy headed into 2016, as new home sales leads to new construction and consumer demand for housing-related goods and services. Despite the positive news, new home sales remain at about 24% below the 50-year average.

Today’s numbers also show that the share of new home sales not started ­ in other words, homes purchased off a plan continue to hover near a 10-year high. Why? The inventory of existing homes continues to fall. Low existing inventory likely pushes prospective buyers away from existing homes towards new homes, and as new home sales rise, this allows builders to sell more new homes off plan.

New Home Sales Summary:
New home sales in December were down 5.2% year-over-year, and 9.2% month-over-month, but both of these numbers aren’t statistically significant.
The 12-month rolling total of new home sales were solid: January 2016 totals were up 11.9% but down 0.4% month-over-month.
The share of new home sales purchased off a plan continues to hover near a 10-year high of 32%."
ralph,Case-Shiller Signals Recovery But Homebuyers Should Be Wary,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller-existing-homes-jan16/,2016-02-23,"The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index expands again and existing home sales normalize, but the share of Americans looking to purchase a home in the next six months is the lowest since August 2015.; Today’s flurry of reports suggests the housing market recovery continues to charge ahead despite concern over global economic conditions, although homebuyers could be getting nervous. The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5.4% year-over-year in December 2015, which is the 44th consecutive month of positive gains. More importantly, November’s number was the 10th consecutive month in which the year-over-year figure increased from the previous month. This continued upward trend of the National Index reflects low unemployment, strong job growth, low inventory, and generally positive consumer sentiment.

Prices in last month’s hot markets – San Francisco, Denver, and Portland – continue to lead the country. Portland topped the list with an 11.4% increase, while San Francisco and Denver grew by 10.3% and 10.2%, respectively. Higher prices in these markets should help increase inventory headed into 2016, but at the same time push some homes out of reach for buyers. When looking at regional groupings, prices in the coastal West, Southwest, and coastal South led the way with year-over-year average price increases of 9.0%, 8%, and 6.3%. Prices in the Midwest and coastal East lagged, showing smaller gains of 4.2% and 3.2%. This suggests continued widening of the price gap between coastal, temperate regions of the country and more inland, northeasterly markets.

Existing home sales stabilized in January after erratic month-over-month swings of -10.7% in November 2015 and +14.7% in December 2015. Though sales in January 2016 are up just 0.4% from December 2015, this modest increase is likely due exceptionally high levels of home sales in December. A large number of expected November homes sales spilled over into December because of delayed closings caused by TILA-RESPA ­ “Know Before You Owe” lending regulations. This caused the normal volume in January to look comparatively small.
Last, the Consumer Confidence Index dropped substantially in February, likely reflecting consumers’ unease over global economic conditions and poor performance in U.S. stock markets. This drop in confidence also spilled over into the housing market: consumers planning on purchasing a home in the next six months decreased from a seasonally-adjusted 7.4% in January to 5.3% in February. This is a six-month low.
Today’s Highlights: 
The U.S. National index for November 2015 was up 5.4% year-over-year.
The three cities with the largest year-over-year gains were Portland, San Francisco, and Denver, with gains of 11.4%, 10.3%, and 10.2%.
Existing home sales in January normalize from a rocky November and December, climbing 0.4% month-over-month.
The share of Americans looking to purchase a home in the next six months is at a six month low, at 5.3%."
ralph,Big Flippers And High Rollers,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/flipping-point-2016/,2016-02-18,"Nationally, there has been little change in house flipping in the past year, but Las Vegas is approaching historical highs, and flipping is making a comeback in several Florida markets.; House flipping is a practice that some believe is an indicator of an over-heated housing market. Nationally, it made up a stable of all home sales during the past year, mirroring a steady increase in home prices.
The good news: that flip rate is roughly in line with the non-housing bubble years and well below the 8.6% flip rate of all home sales in 2006. The concern: there are some hot spots. While stable nationally, we’re having déjà vu: flipping is making a comeback in places such as Las Vegas and Miami, which saw high levels of flipping activity during the previous boom.
Moreover, there’s evidence that house flippers may be sitting out in some markets. That’s because rapid price growth in some expensive markets may be making that initial buy too costly for house flippers.
House flipping is a unique housing market metric for two reasons. First, it is a speculative undertaking where investors are betting on turning a profit, and has historically occurred at high rates just before a market peaks. Second, flipping usually entails removing a home from a particular price point in the market and moving it to a higher price point through improvement. That movement creates competition for homebuyers who may be looking to build sweat-equity on their own. But flipping activity also provides improvements to the housing stock for buyers who don’t have time or cash to improve a home themselves.
Flipping reached a peak in 2006, but is it actually on the rise again? We set out to answer that question by looking at all the home sales in the last year from , and found that:
Nationally, flipping activity has held steady over the past year at around 5% of all home sales, and is down from the peak of 8.6% in the first quarter of 2006;
Flipping is highest is Las Vegas, where 10.4% of home sales are flips, and is about 80% of its 15-year peak. Flipping is lowest in Detroit at just 1.1%;
Over the past year, flipping activity has increased most in Miami, growing from 4.7% to 6.4% of all home sales. Other Florida markets have also seen relatively large increases.

Flipping Down, but Not Out
In the third quarter of 2015, flipping activity held steady year-over-year at around 5% of all home sales. This is down from a peak of 8.6% of all home sales in the first quarter of 2006, but up from a low of if the third quarter of 2008. Why has flipping peaked and troughed over the years? Intense home price fluctuation due to the Great Recession.
Selling houses for a gain over a short period generally requires modest price growth at minimum. Even though flippers can add value by improving the quality of a home, rising prices provide a safety net when taking on a project. When prices are rising faster, flippers have greater opportunity to come out ahead even if the project doesn’t go according to plan. Over the past year, price gains have remained relatively stable, and so have flips. This is stark contrast to rising year-over prices from 2003-2006, when flips increased sharply from 5% to nearly 9% of all home sales.
Flipping Most Common in Las Vegas, Least Common in Detroit
Though flipping has remained relatively stable nationally, flipping activity varies significantly across individual markets. Las Vegas, Nev. leads the pack with 10.4% flips, followed by Fresno, Calif. and Daytona Beach, Fla., with 7.6% and 7.3%, respectively. Detroit and Louisville, Ky., have the lowest share of flips at less than 2.5%.

In addition, three of the top flipping markets are within at least 70% of their 15-year peak. For example, Las Vegas is now 79% of its peak flipping point of 13%, which occurred back in the second quarter of 2005. Baltimore is at 75% of it’s peak flipping point of 9% of home sales in the fourth quarter of 2006, and Richmond, Va., is at 70% of peak flipping, which occurred in the second quarter of 2006.
Florida Markets Flipping Strong
How has flipping changed at the metro level over the past year? Similar to the national numbers, markets with the highest flipping activity generally had higher price appreciation than markets with the lowest.
In particular, flipping is heating up in Florida markets. Of the 10 housing markets with the largest increase in flips over the past year, six are in the Sunshine State. Miami leads the country, increasing 1.7 percentage points. Other flipping hotspots in Florida include Daytona Beach, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, and Cape Coral, which have seen increases in flipping activity between 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points.
While Florida cities have increased the most, bubble-phobes fear not: none are close to their 2000-2015 peak. For example, Miami is at less than a third of its peak flipping point of 20.5%, Daytona Beach is just over half, and Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Cape Coral are just over a third. Of the non-Florida metros making the list, only Las Vegas and Birmingham, Ala., are within about 80% of their 2000-2015 peak.

 We’ve also found an interesting exception between prices and flipping. While there is a strong correlation between price changes and flipping activity over the past year, the relationship doesn’t necessarily hold for those with the smallest change in flipping activity. When grouping our markets by flipping rates, not only do fast-flip markets have the largest average price increase, but the low-flip markets also had large price increases. In other words, places with the biggest increase and biggest decrease in flipping activity over the past year experienced higher than normal price gains.
Why is this? Flipping requires three things: (1) a market where home prices are appreciating, (2) a cheap supply of homes to buy and flip, and (3) ready buyers to purchase the flip.
Flipping a house in appreciating, but expensive markets may be more difficult because:
Homes suitable to purchase for a flip may be more costly and have higher carrying costs, such as taxes and insurance.
The completed flip may take longer to sell because it could end up in a high price tier. Several of the top places with the largest decrease in flipping activity fall into this group, including Los Angeles, San Diego, and Denver.
In conclusion, the U.S. housing market isn’t flipping out just yet, but there are signs that some areas are approaching their previous flipping points. While this isn’t of concern in places where flipping activity is low relative to the national average, such as Birmingham there are signs that markets such as Las Vegas may soon reach an historical high level of flipping.

Methodology
We differentiate between two different types of property flips: a traditional flip, which is the purchase of a house at market rate and selling it at a higher market rate price, because of improvement to the property and/or rising prices; and a clearance flip, which is the purchase of a distressed house at a discount because of a forced sale, such as a foreclosure, followed by a resale at market rate. We do not include clearance flips in our measure of flipping since our goal is to estimate the relationship between prices and flipping in a relatively normal, non-distressed housing market. As a result, our definition of a flip is a property that sold twice in a twelve-month period, in which both transactions are considered arm’s length."
ralph,New Housing Starts Roll Higher Led By South And Northeast,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-housing-starts-1-16/,2016-02-17,"The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts continues to grow, and the February 2015 - January 2016 period represents the best 12-month span for starts since July 2008. The 12-month rolling total of multifamily starts leads the way, and as a share of new starts hovers around a 42-year high. Starts in the South lead the country, but have grown most in the Northeast.; New housing starts grew strongly. The 12-month rolling total of starts ­ which is a more statistically robust measure of trends in housing start data ­ grew 9.4% year-over-year in January to 1,111,900 starts. This represents the most starts in a 12-month period since July 2008, despite a dip in home building sentiment reported yesterday by the NAHB. The dip in confidence was less likely due to a lack of demand for new homes, and more likely related to uncertainty over the health of the global economy. Though the upward trend is good news for the housing sector, the 12-month rolling total is still 23% below a 50-year average of 1,445,779 starts.

Starts of 5+ unit buildings have also shown strong growth over the past year, increasing 10.7% from a 12-month rolling total of 341,900 in January 2015 to 383,600 in January 2016. Multifamily starts in 5+ unit buildings continue to hover around a 42-year high. This upward trend of new starts in multifamily units ­ which tend to primarily consist of renter occupied units ­ likely mirrors strong the growth in new renter-households over the past five years, and may help moderate strong rent growth. However, the share appears to be entering a plateau phase, so we expect increases in multifamily starts may flatten in the rest of 2016.

Finally, regional housing starts continue to show disparities. The South leads the country with a 12-month rolling total of 556,700 new starts, which is the best 12-month span since June 2008. The 12-month rolling total for the Midwest in January was 151,500 units, which is tied for the lowest total since March of 2014. The Northeast led the country in year-over-year growth, increasing by 30.2% and growing from a 12-month rolling total of 109,600 new starts in January 2015 to 141,900 in January of 2016. New starts in the West remain solid, with a 12-month total of 261,700 and year-over-year growth of 9.1%. The disparity between the Midwest and other regions mirrors relatively slower economic growth in Midwestern markets and continued expansion in the South and West.

Housing Starts Summary:
The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts in January were up 9.4% year-over-year;
The 12-month rolling total of new housing starts in 5+ units in January was up 10.7% year-over-year, and makes up over a third of new starts.
The 12-month rolling total of housing starts in the South was the best since June 2008."
ralph,"Jobs Report: Modest Growth, Construction Sector Remains Strong",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/jobs-report-jan-16/,2016-02-05,"Job growth in January started off the year modestly. While wage growth continues to be strong, the gains continued to be outpaced by price and rent growth. Employment in residential construction continues to show strong growth.; Job growth in January started 2016 in modest fashion, adding 151,000 jobs, or 1.9%, year-over-year. It was the 64th consecutive month of gains. This is down from the revised jump of 262,000 in December. Wages posted another strong annual increase, with average hourly earnings growing by 2.5% year-over-year. Last month’s number was revised upwards to 2.7%. As the labor market tightens, we should continue to expect strong gains in wages in 2016. However, while wage growth is good news for households, price and rent increases of 3-4% during the same period have completely offset these wage gains.

On the construction side, job growth from homebuilding activity remains solid, especially from residential trade contractors. The residential construction sector added 29,200 jobs year-over-year, or 4.5% growth, in January. December and January’s numbers were the two largest year-over-year increases since May 2015. Growth in residential specialty trade contractors continues to speed up, growing very strongly with 7.3% year-over-year, and is the fourth straight month of increasing gains. It was the best month since February 2015. This uptick reflects both a solid year for housing starts in 2015 as well as increasing confidence of homebuilders headed into 2016.
Existing Home Sales and Homeownership Highlights: 
Payrolls increased by 151,000 jobs, or 1.9%, year-over-year.
Average hourly earning increased by 2.5% year-over-year, but renters did not realize these gains because of 3% rent increases during the same period.
Residential construction payrolls increased by 4.5% year-over-year, breaking a four-month streak of increasing gains.
Residential specialty trade contractors increased by 7.3% year-over-year, increasing for the fourth straight month."
ralph,"Pending Home Sales Rise, Gen X Home-Buying Spikes",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/pending-home-sales-rise-gen-x-home-buying-spikes/,2016-01-28,"Pending home sales increased slightly in December, suggesting that the big jump in existing sales was likely a result of new mortgage rules. Also, Census data shows Gen X is back in the housing market.; Last month, there was speculation that new federal guidelines, known as TRID-RESPA or “Know Before You Owe,” ­ temporarily drove down home sales in November because it pushed pending sales to a December closing. December’s 14.7% sharp increase in existing home sales supported this speculation. December’s small month-over-month increase of 0.1% pending home sales further suggests that it was the new guidelines, not a sharp increase in demand ­ that drove existing sales last month.
2015 was a positive year for pending home sales, as each month finished with a year-over-year increase in signed contracts. This is sharp contrast to 2014, where 9 of 12 months showed a year-over-year decrease. However, 2015 ended on a less than stellar note. Monthly year-over-year gains dropped from a high of 12.1% in February to 2.5% in November, but rebounded to 4.2% in December. A sharp drop in inventory from December 2014 likely suppressed end of the year gains.
Regionally, there was wide variation in pending home sales. The Northeast led the country with year-over-year gains of 15.3%, but gains were much more modest elsewhere. The Midwest, West, and South posted year-over-year gains of just 3.6%, 3.4%, and 1%, respectively.
Finally, today’s Census Homeownership and Vacancy Survey release also provides optimism that the homeownership rate may have hit bottom in 2015. The bureau’s seasonally adjusted homeownership rate in the fourth quarter increased slightly to 63.7% from 20-year lows of 63.5% in the second quarter of 2015. Of particular note was the sharp increase in the homeownership rate for Gen X’ers. Households aged 35-44 increased their homeownership rate a full 1.2 percentage points, moving from 58.1% to 59.3%. Many Gen Xers lost their homes during the recession, so this is a positive sign that we may be seeing boomerang buyers coming back into housing market. However, the increase was not statistically significant from a year ago.
Existing Home Sales and Homeownership Highlights:
Pending home sales in December were up 4.2% year-over-year, and 0.1% month-over-month.
Pending home sales in each month of 2015 showed year-over-year gains, but slowed considerably from the beginning of the year to the end.
Pending sales jumped in the Northeast led the pack with an 15.3% increase year-over-year.
The ownership rate increased slightly to 63.7%, but ages 35-44 showed a 1.3% point jump."
ralph,"New Home Sales Surge In December And 2015, But Lag Long Term",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/new-home-sales-2015/,2016-01-27,"2015 was the best year for new home sales since 2008 and up 14.5% from 2014, but still well below historical sales. New home sales charge ahead in the West and South, but lag for entry-level homes.; In December 2015, new home sales increased month-over-month by 10.8%, and increased by 9.9% year-over-year. However, both of these numbers should be taken lightly because the margin of error is wide and includes zero. In other words, we can¹t be certain whether the month-over-month or year-over-year actually increased, decreased, or stayed flat.
A better number to look at is the year-to-year change in new home sales, which is up 14.5% on a calendar year basis from 2014. This reflects a slow but steady increase in demand from homebuyers as well as increasing confidence of homebuilders. It also a positive sign for the U.S. economy headed into 2016, as new home sales leads to new construction and consumer demand for housing-related goods and services.
The report also brings mixed news for new homebuyers. On the positive side, new inventory remains relatively stable at around 5.7 months, which means prices for unsold new homes are unlikely to rise much going into the spring buying season. The somber news is that new starter homes continue to make up a relatively low share of new homes. Just 19% of new home sales were below $200,000 in 2015, down from 23% in 2014. This is likely due to a combination of low inventory of new starter homes and fewer first-time homebuyers.

Last, much of the increase in year-to-year home sales was due to increasing activity in the West and South. New home sales increased in the West by 20.5% and by 17.6% in the South. This is especially good news for homebuyers along the costly West Coast who have faced low inventory and sharp price increases over the past three years.

New Home Sales Summary:
New home sales in December were up 9.9% year-over-year, and 10.8% month-over-month, but both of these numbers aren¹t statistically significant.
Year-to-year, the numbers were great: 2015 totals were up 14.5% from 2014 for total starts.
There was some regional variation in new home sales: the West led the pack with 20.5% growth in 2015 over 2014, followed by the South with 17.6% growth."
ralph,"Case-Shiller Index Rises Again, Coasts Heat Up",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller/,2016-01-26,"The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index suggests the U.S housing market may be entering yet another expansionary period headed into 2016. Coastal markets in the West and South led the charge.; Today’s S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 5.3% year-over-year in November 2015, which is the 43rd consecutive month of positive gains. More importantly, November’s number was the ninth straight month in which the year-over-year figure increased over the previous month. This is further evidence that the U.S. housing market is entering a second expansionary phase since the recovery began in May of 2012. This upward trend of the National Index reflects low unemployment, strong job growth and low inventory.

 Prices in last month’s hot markets – San Francisco, Denver, and Portland – continue to surge year-over-year with increases of 11% each. Higher prices in these markets should help increase inventory headed into 2016, but at the same time push some homes out of reach for buyers. Prices in the coastal West, Southwest, and coastal South led the way with year-over-year averages of 8.8%, 7.8%, and 6.3%. Prices in the Midwest and coastal North lagged, showing smaller gains of 3.8% and 3.5%. This suggests a widening of the price gap between coastal, temperate regions of the country and more inland, northeasterly markets.

S&P/Case-Shiller Highlights:
The US National index for November 2015 was up 5.3% year-over-year.
The 10-City Composite index was up 5.3% year-over-year.

ralph,"Existing Home Sales Rally, 2015 Sales The Best In Nearly 10 Years",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/existing-homes-1215/,2016-01-22,"December existing home sales rebound strongly from a disappointing November, suggesting ""Know Before You Owe"" disclosures played a role. 2015 was the best year for existing home sales in 10 years.; Last month, there was speculation that the new “Know Before You Owe” lending regulations, implemented in October, temporarily drove down home sales in November because the rules lengthened the closing process. December’s 14.7% sharp increase supports this speculation and suggests the large rebound was indeed a result of would-be November sales spilling into December.
In the end, 2015 was a very positive year for existing home sales, having finished with 6.5% more sales than 2014 with a total of 5.26 million existing homes sold. In fact, 2015 was the best year for existing home sales since 2006. For prospective homebuyers looking to buy in 2016, this is a good sign that inventory may continue to increase in 2016. That’s because increasing sales numbers require more inventory, and the trajectory since 2010 has been upward. However, supply dropped sharply year-over-year from 4.4 months supply to 3.9 months so tight inventory may continue to plague buyers in the early months of 2016.
We should expect next month’s numbers to stabilize from the erratic November and December swings as agents and lenders continue to adapt to these new lending regulations. Last, the Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates by 0.25% last month didn’t impact existing home sales, since mortgage rates have actually dropped sharply over the past month.
Existing Home Sales Highlights: 
Existing home sales in December were up 7.7%% year-over-year, and 14.7% month-over-month.
These numbers also end 2015 with an estimated 5.26 million sales on the year, which is up 6.5% compared to the 2014 calendar year.
There was substantial regional variation in sales: the Northeast led the pack with an 11.9% increase year-over-year, followed by the Midwest with a 9.9% increase."
ralph,Why The Housing Starts Report Isn’t As Bad As It Seems,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-starts-jan16/,2016-01-20,"December's lower-than-expected numbers aren't enough to diminish the bigger trend, that is: last year's housing starts were the strongest in nearly a decade.; Compared to historical norms, new construction starts are 75% back to normal, which is down from 77% in November 2015 but still up from 70% in December 2014. Year-to-year, total starts are up 10.8% and, for buildings with five or more units, starts are up 12.5%. Given the tight inventory that we’ve seen in many housing markets across the country, today’s release is a positive sign for new housing starts.
The upward trend reflects upward price movements over the past year, which makes homebuilding less risky. Last year was the best year for housing starts in nearly a decade. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates by 0.25% last month didn’t impact builder confidence in breaking ground on new homes. While starts in December 2015  are down from November 2015, monthly numbers are highly volatile so we can’t be confident of any meaningful impact of interest rates.
The larger year-to-year increase in starts with five or more units reflects greater demand from renter households, which is in-line with the trend in starts we’ve seen over the past few years. For prospective homebuyers, this is a positive sign that we expect some relief of tight inventory, especially in the Costly Coasts, where starts are up 26.8% in the Northeast and 13.4% in the West. Moreover, renters can continue to expect relief due to the surge in five-plus units.
Finally, we should be cautious regarding this month’s year-over-year and month-over-month numbers as the margin of error tells us that the actual number could be flat. We can, however, be confident in comparing the 2014 and 2015 totals.
Housing Starts Summary:
New housing starts in December were +6.4% year-over-year, and -2.5% month-over-month.
Year-to-year, the numbers were great: 2015 totals were up 10.8% from 2014 for total starts, and up 12.5% for starts with 5 or more units.
There was some regional variation in starts: the Northeast led the pack with +26.8% growth in 2015 over 2014 , followed by the West with 13.4% growth."
ralph,Polarity or Parity in the Housing Market?,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/ralph-mclaughlin/,2016-01-19,"Trulia’s new chief economist shares his take on the future of the U.S. housing market and what’s important when you’re looking at real estate markets.; Hi, I’m Ralph McLaughlin, Trulia’s new chief economist. For the past year and a half, I’ve had an absolute blast unearthing digestible insights for buyers, sellers, and renters as Trulia’s housing economist, including reports on student debt, affordability, and where “bargain” homes are actually a bargain. Prior to joining Trulia, I was the director of the Real Estate Development program at San Jose State University.
As Trulia’s chief economist, I’m excited to lead a team of forward-thinking analysts in creating reports that combine innovative data analysis with straight talk on what’s going on in U.S. housing markets. You can find our thoughts, analysis, and opinions on the Trulia Research Blog, Twitter (follow me @TruliaRalph), and through the media.
Housing in 2020 – Polarity or Parity?Not too long ago, housing left a sour taste on America’s palate. Prices were down, foreclosures were high, and the prospects of a quick recovery were bleak. We’re now five years since the turnaround, and our nation’s housing market is looking like a tale of two countries. Along what we call the Costly Coasts – markets in the pricey West and Northeast – job growth and home prices have boomed and affordability has tanked. In the Bargain Belt – markets in the Midwest and South – home price appreciation and job growth has been slower, but homeownership is affordable. For comparison, prices along the Costly Coasts have risen, on average, about 26% between 2011 and 2015, while prices in the Bargain Belt have increased just 14%. In the next five years, will the U.S. housing market continue to polarize, or will the Costly Coasts cool and the Bargain Belt boom? It’s a question we’re going to keep a close eye on as the recovery continues. The outcome has important ramifications for the future of the U.S. economy and housing policy.
At a micro-level, many first-time homebuyers may have also noticed a polarizing trend when it comes to finding a home. Starter homes are not only hard to come by, but they’re also flying off the market faster than middle-tier and luxury homes. In fact, 57% of homes priced in the lower-tier are still on the market after two months, compared to 61% for middle-tier and nearly 70% for upper-tier homes. This is yet another hurdle for those wanting to get their first taste of homeownership. Not only is saving up for a down payment and qualifying for a mortgage difficult for newbies, but starter homes are the most difficult to acquire. Will this trend reverse, or is difficult the new easy for first-timers? We’ll continue to dig-deep on what current housing trends mean for those looking to buy their first home.
What to Expect from Trulia’s Housing Economics Research Team in 2016First off, Trulia’s housing economics research team had a fantastic 2015. We will continue to publish regular reports such as “Rent vs. Buy” and “Fastest Moving Markets.” We’ll also continue to throw in out-of-the-box insights, like million-dollar homes in San Francisco, turnaround towns, and pet-friendly rental markets. But more importantly, we’ll also dive into timely, but sometimes overlooked topics that are of the utmost importance to both house hunters and policy-makers. Stay tuned."

As it turns out, how much depends on where you live. Assuming the winner takes a lump sum of $600 million after taxes, we calculated how much of the current inventory in each of the biggest 100 markets could be bought with the winnings.
Looking to buy all the homes on the market to start your real estate empire? Head to Toledo, Ohio, and Wichita, Kans., where the winner could purchase each and every home that is currently listed on Trulia. Not only are homes cheap in these markets, but they’re also the smallest of the biggest 100 metros, so total inventory is low. In the remaining eight metros where you can purchase the most homes, the winner could scoop at least 90% of current inventory.

On the other hand, winners looking to buy in large metropolitan areas might want to think twice. In New York and Long Island, only 9% and 16% of inventory could be picked up. New York comes to the bottom not only because it is the largest metro in the US but also because it’s a pricey market. Other large metros, such as Miami and Los Angeles, also come to the bottom of the list both because of their sheer size and their relatively high prices. Of the remaining 10 places where winners can buy the fewest homes on the market, no more than 24% of listings could be acquired.

Why aren’t pricey markets like San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, Calif. on the bottom the list? Because the share of homes on the market that could be purchased is determined not just by how expensive homes are, but how many are on the market. In the costly Bay Area you could buy between 42-47% of inventory, which would go further than spending your winnings in Phoenix, Houston, and Atlanta. This is because although Phoenix, Houston, and Atlanta are cheaper, there are more homes on the market because the metros are larger.

ralph,Where Is A “Bargain” Really A Bargain?,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/bargain-homes/,2016-01-07,"Homes advertised as a bargain aren’t necessarily a good deal. Only 55 of the 100 biggest U.S. housing markets where properties described as a “bargain” are actually listed for a lower price.; The B-word – bargain – gets thrown around a lot in the real estate world. Buyers are looking for one, and sellers often use the term to market their home. But talk is cheap, so we’ve combed through all the homes for sale on Trulia in the 100 largest housing markets to find out where properties listed with the word bargain, or similar words, are actually priced at a discount. To no surprise, we found that not all properties listed as bargains are actually a good deal.
In fact,
Homes listed for sale with the term “bargain” (or similar) in their description are offered for a lower price compared to other listings without such terms, in only 55 of the largest 100 U.S. housing markets;
Markets with the largest discount on bargain properties are in the Bargain Belt, where markdowns range from 10-20%;
Markets with the smallest discount on bargain properties are mostly along the Costly Coasts, where price cuts range from just 2-4%.
Bargain Discount Highest in Bargain Belt, Lowest on Costly Coasts 
Homebuyers in Midwestern and Southern markets – a region we collectively call the Bargain Belt – are more likely to find that properties described as a bargain actually come with a discount. Of the top 10 housing markets with the largest discount, five are in the Bargain Belt. Dayton and Toledo, Ohio, lead the pack, where, on average, bargain properties come with a 19.6% and 18.1% markdown, respectively. On the median priced home, this translates to a $22,900 price cut in Dayton and $19,848 cut in Toledo. Knoxville, Tenn., Buffalo, and Omaha, Neb., round out the top five, where price reductions range from 11.5%-12.8%.

In general, homebuyers in faster-appreciating and expensive markets can expect smaller discounts on bargain properties. This is due to the fact that in tighter markets, sellers don’t need to offer as many concessions – price or otherwise – when demand outstrips supply. However, in cooler markets with slower home price appreciation, the opposite is true. Buyers in such markets can be much pickier with the characteristics of their properties, so sellers are much more likely to offer discounts, accommodations, and concessions to prospective homebuyers.
While we find that a bargain really means a bargain in just 55 of the largest 100 housing markets, it doesn’t mean that bargains can’t be found in the other 45. Rather, it means that there are just as many bargain properties listed for less than the average property as there are listed for more. So buyer beware: in markets such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco, that fixer-upper on the corner lot listed as a bargain might not actually be such a great deal.
Methodology
To determine whether for-sale listings being described as a bargain are actually a good deal, we tested whether there is a bargain effect on listing prices using a hedonic model. First, we looked at the all single-family homes listed for sale on Trulia in the 100 largest U.S. metros from January 2013 through December 2015 and identified which ones were described with the words “bargain,” “value,” “deal”and the phrases “under valued,” “fixer upper” and “under priced.”
We then estimated a hedonic model to determine the effect of the bargain term on the home’s listing price while controlling for the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square feet, lot size, age, and zip code of each property. This allowed us estimate how much of a discount properties with a bargain term were listed for, on average, than similar properties within the same metro without a bargain term. We used a 10% level for statistical significance, and employed a 5% trimmed sample to reduce the effects of outliers on the regression estimates.
Only metros where the bargain term coefficient was significant were considered true bargain markets. Among the 100 largest U.S. metros that we examined, just 55 made the cut. We then calculated the average listing price discount for each of these 55 metros. For demonstrative purposes, we use the median listing price from January 2013 – December 2015 to show, on average, the discount in dollars on the median priced home."
ralph,Where 15 Can Beat 30,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/where-15-can-beat-30/,2015-12-16,"A 15-year mortgage is a smart choice for households in housing markets where price increases have been modest, but a tougher call for households in hotter markets.; The Federal Reserve Board is on track to raise interest rates as soon as today. It’s a move that will mean higher mortgage rates, higher monthly payments, and reduced purchasing power for new borrowers. Homebuyers, who haven’t seen an interest rate increase in nearly 10 years, may be tempted by lower-rate 15-year mortgages. But do the advantages of a 15-year mortgage outweigh the costs? The answer depends partly on where you live.
We’ve crunched the numbers for the largest U.S. metros, and found that:
With the median US household income, a 30-year mortgage allows homebuyers to purchase 46% more house, but a 15-year mortgage provides triple the paid equity in just 5 years.
Homebuyers in areas where prices have a history of rising will benefit greatly from faster equity-building with a 15-year mortgage.
Buyers in areas with historically slow growing to flat housing prices will benefit less from shorter-term mortgages and potentially more from the borrowing power of a 30-year loan.
The Tradeoffs Between 30- and 15-year Mortgages
In general, 30-year mortgages have three advantages:
Monthly payments are lower
Borrowing power is higher
Tax benefits are greater
The primary advantage of a 30-year mortgage is lower monthly payments. On the median valued U.S. home, a 30-year mortgage comes with a payment that is $320, or 27%, lower than a 15-year mortgage. Lower payments also mean that a borrower’s debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is lower than a 15–year loan. This allows middle class buyers (a household earning the U.S. median income) to borrow $77,000, or 46%, more with a 30-year mortgage than a 15-year. Last, borrowers with a 30-year mortgage can write off nearly $68,000 more than a 15-year mortgage via the mortgage-interest deduction on their federal income taxes.

A 15-year mortgage has three advantages over a 30-year mortgage:
Equity builds faster
Interest rates are lower
Loan term is shorter
The primary advantage of a 15-year mortgage is that a larger share of each monthly payment goes towards paying off the loan principal. After five years (the number of years the average young household moves), equity gained from paying off the loan balance is more than $39,000, or three-times greater with a 15-year mortgage on the median value home. In addition, the 15-year rate is 3.36%, compared with 4.12% for a 30-year note. And over the loan term, borrowers with 15-year mortgages pay just under $40,000 in interest with a 15-year compared to over $107,000 with a 30-year on the median value home.
In Bargain Markets, 15-year Mortgages Are A Homebuyer’s Best Bet For Equity
Home equity can come from three sources: down payment, principal reduction, and home value appreciation. This means that in markets with slow appreciation, a larger share of equity will come from homeowners paying down the loan balance when compared to home value appreciation. In such markets, 15-year loans offer a relatively faster route to building equity.

We’ve identified the 10 markets in the country where, after five years of ownership, homeowners will have the most equity from principal reduction relative to home price appreciation. At the top of the list are markets exclusively in the Bargain Belt (Midwest and Southeast). In each of these markets, 15-year mortgages can provide over twice the equity relative to home price appreciation. For example, homeowners in Dayton, Ohio, can earn $22,018 in equity from mortgage payments with a 15-year mortgage, which is 2.37-times greater than the $9,295 gained from price appreciation. With a 30-year mortgage, payments would net households just $7,393. Clearly, household in these markets would gain much more equity by paying down their mortgage principle with a 15-year loan than from home value appreciation.

In Pricey Markets, 15-year Mortgages Are A Tougher Call
In markets with strong home price appreciation, deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage is a tougher call. Like bargain markets, 15-year loans provide more equity from principal repayment than from appreciation. The difference, however, is much smaller. In pricey San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., 15-year mortgages provide just 1.35 times more equity from principal payoff than appreciation. Still, the difference in equity from principal repayment is great between a 30-year and a 15-year mortgage. For example, households in Orange County would stand to gain nearly $100,000 more in equity after 5 years by choosing a 15-year mortgage.

Even though 15-year mortgages provide more equity through loan repayment than appreciation, they also come at the expense of borrowing power. In high-priced markets, the difference in nominal terms can be substantial. For example, middle class families in San Francisco (households making the median income of $104,000 per year) could purchase a $628,000 home with a 30-year mortgage but only a $430,000 home with a 15-year. This makes house hunting hard when the median priced home costs more than $1 million. As a results, this could be the difference between buying their dream-home or a starter for some households.
To show why households in expensive housing markets have a much tougher decision, we’ve put together a scatterplot of median home values for each of the 100 largest U.S. metros and matched it with the relative amount of equity a household can gain from payments on a 15-year mortgage. As you can see, households in cheaper markets (bottom axis) stand to gain relatively more equity (left axis) from paying down their mortgage with a 15-year note than through home value appreciation when compared to pricier markets. For example, households in affordable Cleveland, which has a median home value of $123,000, can reap 2.25 times the equity from loan repayment than appreciation. In San Francisco, the land of million dollar homes, the added value is only 1.34 times the equity.

The takeaway: 15-year mortgages are a great option for those wanting to build equity, regardless of how expensive or how fast growing a market is. However, in places with historically low appreciation, 15-year mortgages are a much better deal for building equity because it’s about the only way to do so though paying of the loan balance. On the other hand, in areas with historically high price appreciation that also happen to be expensive, households need to consider the tradeoffs between the borrowing power of 30-year mortgages, expected equity from home price appreciation, and whether or not they will use equity from their existing home as a down payment on their next one.
Methodology
To compare 30- and 15-year mortgages, we estimate the amount of equity a household would gain from both appreciation and from paying off the principal after 5-years of homeownership of the median valued home. We estimate this separately for each of the 100 largest U.S. metros, and use an annualized 20-year Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA) house price growth rate to project home values 5 years into the future. Last, we compare the nominal and relative amount of equity a household would gain by choosing either a 30- or 15-year mortgage and comparing that to the expected gain in equity from home value appreciation."
ralph,"Housing in 2016: Hesitant Households, Costly Coasts, and the Bargain Belt",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/2016-housing-predictions/,2015-12-03,"Pessimism is creeping back into the housing market – how much depends on where you live and how much housing costs.; It’s been a decade since the peak of the housing bubble, and the boom and bust seems to have only temporarily diminished Americans’ obsession for real estate. For many, owning a home is making a comeback as an essential part of their personal American Dream. At the same time there’s a growing sense that achieving that dream will be difficult in the year ahead.
As part of our annual look at the year ahead in housing, we commissioned Harris Poll to conduct a survey online in November among more than 2,000 Americans about their housing hopes and fears. We noticed some striking trends. Among them:
The American Dream of homeownership is not only alive and well, but continues its resurgence. The share of Americans who dream of owning a home is again up since last year: 1 percentage-point to 75%, and up 2 points among millennials to 80%.
More than one in five (22%), Americans think it will be harder to get a mortgage in 2016 than it was in 2015, perhaps because of looming interest rate increases.
Among millennials telling us that they plan to buy a home, nearly a third (31%) tell us they want to buy within two years, so by 2018. However, jobs and down payments are keys to turning these renters into homeowners within the next 12 months.
 
In addition to the survey, we at Trulia put together a short list of predictions for 2016:
Housing markets in the West and Northeast that we’ve defined as the Costly Coasts will continue to cool, but will boom in the Southern and Midwestern markets we call the Bargain Belt.
Renters may get some relief in costly metros, where multifamily construction is booming.
Buying will remain a better deal than renting nationally, even if mortgage rates increase. But in several California markets, renting might become cheaper than buying.
And finally, we’ve identified a list of 10 markets to watch in 2016 based on a healthy combination of affordability, job growth, and online search activity. Half of these markets are in the Bargain Belt, and so are the top 3: Grand Rapids, Mich., Charleston, S.C., and Austin, Texas.
 
3 in 4 Americans Still Bullish on Homeownership, but Have Reservations About 2016Consumers’ fondness for homeownership as part of their American Dream is high and growing slightly. In our survey, we found that three-quarters of Americans (75%) agreed that home ownership is part of achieving their personal American Dream – which is slightly higher than 74% who answered last year and five percentage points higher than in 2012. For young adults, the dream is higher and also up slightly: 80% of 18-34 year-olds answered yes to our American Dream question, up from 78% in 2014 and a low of 65% in 2011.

But consumers are having mixed feelings about 2016. First, the good news: 30% of American adults say 2016 will be better than 2015 for selling a home. The bad news: Fewer adults are as confident as they were in last year’s survey. There was a full 20 percentage-point difference than the previous year, but it’s down to 14 points this year. Furthermore, the gap between those who think next year will be better or worse for buying a home has been cut in half to 5 percentage points from 10. Meanwhile, the sentiment around the rental market isn’t any more optimistic. Only a slightly higher number of Americans said that they think 2016 will be worse than 2015 to rent a home than said it will be better.

Note: The survey question asked U.S. Adults in 2015 whether they thought 2016 will be better or worse for each of the options above. The percentage of people who said it would be “better” was then subtracted from the percentage who said it would be “worse” to determine their outlook. To illustrate the difference over time, last year’s results are presented, which asked U.S. adults in 2014 whether they though 2015 would be better or worse. The figures above are percentage point differences. 
What factors might be driving this drop in optimism home buying and selling? Renters are telling us that saving for a down payment is still the biggest obstacle to home buying (42%), with responses slightly higher than last year, followed by poor credit (27%) and qualifying for a mortgage (24%).
The Federal Reserve has expressed commitment to raising rates at the end of 2015 or early 2016, and consumers may be getting anxious about the prospect of increased mortgage rates. A higher percentage of Americans think getting a mortgage to buy (25%) or refinance (22%) a home will become harder in 2016 than those who think it will be easier (20% for both), even though increased mortgage rates won’t effect the financial advantages of buying in most housing markets.

When asked what would encourage them to buy a home rather than continue to rent, 51% of millennial renters say that a new job, promotion or raise would, followed by having enough or a down payment (50%) and improved credit history (36%).

Housing in 2016: Costly Coasts Cool, Bargain Belt Booms, and Buying Remains a BargainInvestors fueled the initial housing market recovery. By the end of 2013, bargain buys were harder to come by, and investors started retreating. 2014 and 2015 brought solid job growth to many metros, which helped fuel an emergence of new households, especially renters. As much of Trulia’s research has shown, this drove a steep year-over-year price and rent increases in many of the coastal markets, but metros in the heartland remained affordable. Will this polarization trend continue, or will the gap between booming metros and stagnant ones converge? Will renters get relief? And will rising interest rates make it a better deal to rent?
Here’s what we expect in 2016:
Costly Coasts CoolWe expect housing markets along the Costly Coasts – namely, expensive metros in the West and Northeast– to continue slowing. In many of these coastal metros, affordability has decreased, homes are staying on the market slightly longer, and saving for a down payment can take decades.
Consumers are also starting to feel pessimistic about homes along the costly coasts. Those in the combined regions of the West and Northeast say getting a mortgage to buy or refinance a home will be worse in 2016 than better (10 percentage-points more said it would be worse than better to get a mortgage to buy a home, 7 points for refinance). Likewise, more Americans in these combined regions also said 2016 will be worse for renting a home than better (by a margin of 8 percentage-points).
Taken together, these factors lead us to believe household formation will wane in these metros 2016, which should help moderate price and rent growth. But due to a limited supply of new single-family homes in these metros, we don’t anticipate prices to fall anytime soon.

Note: The survey question asked U.S. Adults in 2015 whether they thought 2016 will be better or worse for each of the options above. The percentage of people who said it would be “better” was then subtracted from the percentage who said it would be “worse” to determine their outlook. To illustrate the difference over time, last year’s results are presented, which asked U.S. adults in 2014 whether they though 2015 would be better or worse. The figures above are percentage point differences. 
 
Bargain Belt BoomsOn the other hand, we expect highly affordable housing markets in the Midwest and South — an area we’ve identified as the Bargain Belt — to pick up. We’ve seen glimpses of this in 2015: metros like Winston-Salem, N.C., and Charlotte, N.C., have seen the biggest year-over-year increase in how quickly homes move off the market. And in metros like Akron, Ohio, Cincinnati and Kansas City buying was an even better deal in 2015 compared to 2013 and 2014.
Consumers are also upbeat about the Bargain Belt. In every category except getting a mortgage to buy a home, those in the combined region of the South and Midwest think 2016 will be better than worse. The largest differential was in selling a home, but those in the Bargain Belt also feel particularly optimistic about buying and renting a home.
 
Buying Remains Cheaper than RentingIn 2015, Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy report found that buying was a better deal than renting in 98 of the largest 100 markets and offered the best value in those markets since 2012. Although interest rates are sure to rise, we think buying will continue to beat renting. Nationally, interest rates would have to rise to about 6.5% for the costs of buying to equate renting. The interest rate tipping point for many metros is in the double digits. Coupled with tempered price growth, this should keep buying a better deal than renting.
However, we do expect that a rise in interest rates will affect markets in California. While demand for homes in the Golden State may continue to push higher in 2016, an increase of mortgage rates to 4.5% (read: two 0.25% Fed rate increases) would actually push the rent vs buy math close to renting in the Bay Area, Sacramento, Calif., Ventura County, Calif., and San Diego.
 
Renters May Get Some Relief2016 may bring relief for renters, who have endured sharp rent increases in many markets over the past few years. Multifamily housing construction, which disproportionally leads to new rental units, is booming in several markets. New multifamily permits in 2015 were exceptionally high in the Northeast – it’s 423% higher than the 25-year norm in New York, 295% higher in Boston, and 290% higher in Newark, N.J. Multifamily construction is even high relative to historic norms in stingy San Francisco (102% higher) and Los Angeles (160%).
However, much of our prediction is based on expectations that household formation remains steady. New work from our old friend Jed Kolko suggests the share of 18-35 year olds living with their parents today may be the new normal. If this is indeed the trend, new household formation will likely remain steady and new rental supply should keep pace with new demand. However, if the economy surges and younger workers quickly get pulled into the workforce, new household formation may outpace supply and rents increases could continue.
 
Markets to Watch in 2016While we expect some of the hottest housing markets to continue cooling in 2016, we have identified 10 markets that we think have strong potential for growth in the year ahead. These markets exhibit strength in five key metrics: strong job growth over the past year, low vacancy rates, high affordability, more inbound home searches than outbound, and a large share of millennials. They are:
Grand Rapids–Wyoming, MI
Charleston, SC
Austin, TX
Baton Rouge, LA
San Antonio, TX
Colorado Springs, CO
Columbia, SC
Riverside–San Bernardino, CA
Las Vegas, NV
Tacoma, WA
Grand Rapids, Mich., tops our list because it ranks particular affordable (14th most affordable in the US) and has strong job growth (22nd strongest in past year). Charleston, S.C., ranks second because it has even higher job growth (6th in the US) and very high share of inbound home searches (ranked 5th), but falters in affordability (66th) and vacancy rate (52nd). Austin, Texas, ranks third on our list because of its strength in two categories: share of millennials and job growth (ranks 3rd in both categories). Five of our ten metros to watch in 2016 are Southern (Charleston, Austin, Baton Rouge, La., San Antonio, Texas, and Columbia, S.C.), while three are in the non-coastal West (Colorado Springs, Riverside-San Bernardino, and Las Vegas), one in the Midwest (Grand Rapids), and just one in the coastal West (Tacoma, Wash.). No Northeastern metros make our list to watch, primarily because of low affordability, modest employment growth, and relatively few millennials.
 
Full Survey MethodologyThe 2015 survey was conducted online within the United States between November 19th and 23rd, 2015 among 2,016 adults (aged 18 and over) by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia via its Quick Query omnibus product. Of those surveyed, 1,194 were homeowners and 740 were renters. By age group, 577 are aged 18-34 years old, 706 are aged 35-44 years old, and 733 are aged 55+ years old.
The 2014 survey was conducted online within the United States between November 6th and 10th, 2014 among 2,008 adults (aged 18 and over) by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia via its Quick Query omnibus product.
Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online.
All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, the words “margin of error” are avoided as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal.
Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in our panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

ralph,"For Millennials, Buying an Unaffordable Home Isn’t Always a Bad Idea",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/buy-unaffordable-home/,2015-11-11,"In metros with high-income growth, unaffordable mortgage payments can become affordable within a few years.; Financial experts say buying an unaffordable home, where monthly mortgage payments exceed 31% of a household’s income, is usually a bad idea. And for the most part, we agree. Homes are expensive to acquire and maintain, and mortgage payments are almost always a household’s biggest single expense. Outsized mortgage payments can lead to household financial stress down the road.
But in many housing markets where most workers see strong wage and income growth – New Haven, Conn., Providence, R.I., and Newark, N.J., among them – mortgage payments actually shrink as part of the monthly budget and can become affordable within just a few years and, in some places, in just a few months.
On the flipside, we found that in some metros – San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York to name a few – home prices are so high and wage growth so sluggish that for the life of loan, chances are buyers will always be shelling out 31% or more of their income for mortgage costs.
We’ve crunched the numbers to identify where, and when, buying an unaffordable home might not be such a terrible idea. To do this, we’ve identified metros:
Where the median home is feasibly unaffordable to millennial households (25-34 year olds), that is, where initial mortgage payments exceed 31% the federal government’s definition of unaffordable –
And those payments don’t exceed 43% of income, the limit a vast majority of lenders place on new mortgages
And finally, we projected lifecycle income growth of millennial households to calculate the number of years it would take for mortgage payments to drop below 31% of a household’s income.
Where Buying an Unaffordable Home Isn’t a Terrible IdeaFirst, the good news. Of the 100 largest housing markets in the U.S., initial mortgage payments are affordable in 73. In the most affordable of these 73 markets, initial payments constitute 20% or less of median household income. What’s more, households in the top 10 most affordable markets end up paying 7% or less of their income towards their mortgage payments by the end of the loan. For example, in Columbia, S. C., where home prices are low but income growth is strong, mortgage payments drop from 17.0% of monthly income at the beginning of the loan to 6.6% at the end.

On the flipside, the median priced home is feasibly unaffordable to millennials in 17 of the largest 100 markets. Though mortgage payments are initially unaffordable in these metros, affordability comes quickly. In places like Washington, DC, Silver Spring, Md., Madison, Wis., and Tacoma, Wash., that number is less than two years. Even in some pricey East Coast metros, such as Cambridge, Mass., Fairfield, Conn., Boston and Long Island, N.Y., mortgage payments become affordable in less than six years.

In these metros, the number of years it takes for unaffordable payments to become affordable is primarily determined by the magnitude of initial unaffordability. Metros that are just barely unaffordable, such as Washington, DC, and Silver Spring, Md., become affordable rather fast, whereas metros that are more unaffordable, such as Boston and Seattle, take time. But if we look at the entire 30-year lifecycle of a mortgage, other metros of see quite a large reduction because of the compounding effect of long-term income growth.
Where Income Growth Has the Biggest Impact on Mortgage PaymentsMillennials in the Northeast and California stand to benefit most from the largest potential drop in income spent on mortgage payments over the life of a loan. This is largely due to the fact that the projected income growth in these metros is high. New Haven, Conn., tops the list, where millennials can expect mortgage payments to drop from 37.0% of household income to 11.2% over 30 years – a 25.7 percentage point decrease. Several other East Coast metros make the list as well – millennials buying the median priced home today in Fairfield, Conn., Providence, R.I., Cambridge, Mass., and Silver Spring, Md., can expect a reduction in payments of at least 20 percentage points over the life of the mortgage.

Where Buying an Unaffordable Home Isn’t Such a Great IdeaLast, there are 10 metros where millennials might not want to buy a home (and might not even qualify for a mortgage) because unaffordable payments persist for much of the loan term. To no surprise, many pricey West Coast metros top the list. For example, millennials in Ventura County, Calif., San Diego and Los Angeles would have to wait approximately 9 and half years, 16 years 3 months, and 25 years 3 months, respectively, until income growth makes mortgage payments affordable. In pricey San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., unaffordable payments would persist for the life of the loan. The only non-West Coast metro to make the list is Newark, N.J., where mortgage payments become affordable in a little over 10 years.

MethodologyBuying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions a household can make. In general, buying is a better financial decision than renting, but at the same time, median housing prices in several markets are unaffordable and down payments can be hard to come by. So the decision can be tough. If households plan on staying in their home for a long period of time, buying an unaffordable home probably isn’t a terrible idea. If a household moves often, it’s almost certainly a better idea to rent.
We developed a three-step process to identify metro areas where buying an unaffordable home might not be a terrible idea, First, we classify markets as “feasible unaffordable” if the monthly mortgage payment (assuming a 10% down payment and mortgage insurance) on the median priced home falls between 31% and 43% of median monthly income for millennials (ages 25-34). We base this on a combination of the federal government’s 31% affordability threshold and qualified mortgage guidelines that cap borrowers’ debt-to-income ratio at 43%.
 Second, we’ve estimated projected 30-year income growth of millennial households. To do so, we looked at the percentage difference in median household income between households aged 25-34 and households aged 55-64 in each metro using 2014 American Community Survey Data. We annualized this percentage over 30 years to get an idea of how much income growth a 25-34 year old can expect over their career, and then, assuming an inflation rate of 2%, use it project future monthly income for the median 25-34 year old household.
 Last, we divided the monthly mortgage payment, including taxes and homeowners insurance, by the projected monthly income to determine the median share of income spent on housing for each month of the loan term. For each of the largest 100 metros, we then examined the number of months into the future when mortgage payments drop below 31% of monthly income."
ralph,Should Millennials Rent or Buy?,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/millennials-rent-or-buy/,2015-10-21,"A tougher call for younger house hunters, especially in California, if mortgage rates rise; Buying a home is 23% cheaper than renting nationwide for millennials and now is the best time to buy since 2012 when interest rates were a tad lower.
Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy Report has traditionally assumed a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with a 20% down payment for households moving every seven years. With these assumptions, buying is 36% cheaper than renting on a national basis, based on September home prices. That’s the best differential since 2012 when it was 38% cheaper to buy than rent. Buying is also cheaper than renting in each of the nation’s 100 largest metros.
However, using the Census’ 2014 American Community Survey and a new Trulia consumer poll, we’ve found that the math is different for young households (ages 25-34), who tend to move every five years (*) and can only afford up to a 10% down payment (**). This edition of Rent vs. Buy crunches the numbers for these prospective home buyers.
To compare the costs of owning and renting for young home buyers, we also assumed a 3.85% mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan, itemized federal tax deductions and a 25% tax bracket. With those assumptions, buying is not only 23% cheaper than renting nationally, it is also only cheaper than renting in 98 of the nation’s top 100 markets.

But personal choices aside, here are the current economic conditions that influence today’s market. Nationally, home price growth has outpaced rent growth since 2012. That favors the rent side of the buy vs. rent equation. However, interest rates have returned to near historic lows, now at about 3.85%, after climbing to 4% or higher in 2013 and 2014. In October 2012, rates were about 3.4% for a 30-year-fixed rate mortgage. In that year, young households found that it was 28% cheaper to buy than rent.
Cheaper to Rent in Honolulu and Silicon ValleyThe rent vs. buy gap differs vastly across metros, largely because home prices and rents, property taxes, and home-price appreciation differs by metro. Taking these factors into account, young home buyers in the nation’s 100 markets would find that buying a home ranges from being 5% more expensive than renting in Honolulu to being 46% cheaper to buy a home in Houston.
The only other metro in the top 100 where buying is more expensive than renting a home for young buyers is San Jose, where they’d pay 2% more to buy a home than to rent. Rounding out the top 10 is New York, where buying is now 11% cheaper for younger consumers than renting.
Our rent vs. buy metric is especially tight for young prospective buyers in California. Of the 10 markets nationwide where buying vs. renting is a tougher call, seven are in the Golden State: San Jose, Orange County, San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, and Ventura County.

Southern, Midwestern Housing Markets Great for Young BuyersBuying is clearly a better deal in many Southern markets. Metros in Texas, Florida and Louisiana dominate the top ten list of places where young households will find buying an easier call. In No. 1 Houston, for instance, it is 46% cheaper for younger buyers to buy than rent.

Rising Prices, Rents in Some Markets Spur Big Swings in Rent vs. Buy MathMany metros have seen drastic swings in our rent vs. buy metric since 2012 when the housing market first started to turn around. That’s largely because of rebounding home prices and swings in how much prices rise relative to rents, and vice-versa.
In Las Vegas, for example, it is now 20% cheaper to buy than rent. In 2012, it was a whopping 43% cheaper to buy than rent in that metro. Much of this change is due to the fact that price increases outpaced rents in Las Vegas. The median cost of a Las Vegas home has soared to $194,789, up from $124,575 in 2012. Median monthly rents, meanwhile, have risen just $100 in the same period to $1,250. This difference led to an almost 23 percentage point drop in the advantage of buying vs. renting.

In some markets, rent growth has outpaced home price growth. That has made home buying an even better financial choice vs. renting in those markets now than in 2012. However, the changes haven’t been as drastic as in Las Vegas.
For example, in San Antonio—which tops the list of 10 metros where buying a home is an even better deal vs. renting now than it was three years ago—younger home buyers would find buying now almost 42% cheaper than renting, up from 33% cheaper in 2012. That makes for an eight-percentage point difference in our buy vs. rent metric.

Higher Mortgage Rates Could Spur Renting in CaliforniaMany economists predict that the Federal Reserve Bank will raise interest rates, now near historic lows, by the year’s end. Nationally, rates would have to nearly double to about 6.5% to equalize the buy vs. rent equation for young buyers. Still, an increase of 25-50 basis points could push mortgage rates to 4.15% – 4.4%. That would make the costs of renting about the same as buying in some large California markets.

Orange County, San Francisco, and Oakland are the most vulnerable markets. An increase of interest rates of half a basis point (0.5 percentage points) would make the costs of buying in those markets about the same as renting. In other vulnerable markets, the rate increase would need to be closer to 1.00-1.35 percentage points.  However, home buyers in these metros don’t need to panic. The Fed hasn’t increased rates by more than 25 basis points at a time since the Fall of 1988.
 
 
FULL RENT VS. BUY METHODOLOGYTrulia calculates the costs of buying and renting by:
We use our quality-adjusted measure of home prices and rents, which allows an apples-to-apples comparison between rental and owner-occupied housing units. We looked at median home value and rent in September 2015 in each of the largest 100 metros.
We calculate the initial total monthly costs of owning and renting, including mortgage payments, maintenance, insurance, and taxes.
We calculate the future total monthly costs of owning and renting, taking into account expected price and rent appreciation, as well as projected inflation.
We factor in one-time costs and proceeds, including closing costs, down payment, sale proceeds, and security deposits.
We calculate net present value, which reveals the opportunity cost of using money to buy a house instead of investing it. Net present value is the worth in today’s dollars of a future stream of payments and proceeds, taking into account expected interest rates.
Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy Calculator lets you compare renting and buying costs using other assumptions about prices, rents, and other factors. It uses the same math that powers our interactive map and this report. You can read our extended methodology here.
(*) 2014 American Community Survey Data shows that Americans aged 25-34 move approximately every five years.
(**) When asked how much their household would be able to put down as a down payment, if they were in the market for a home, 62% of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 said they could only afford a downpayment of 10% or less on a home purchase.
This survey was conducted online within the United States between October 13th and 15th, 2015 among 2,009 adults (aged 18 and over) of whom 383 are 25-34 by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia via its Quick Query omnibus product. Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online.
All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, the words “margin of error” are avoided as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal.
Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in our panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated."
ralph,"In the City by the Bay, You’ll Pay a Million Bucks for a Home",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/sf-million-dollar-homes/,2015-10-08,"Million dollar homes in San Francisco have more than doubled since 2010, and some neighborhoods have seen even bigger spikes.; San Francisco is the City by the Bay, and home to the Golden Gate Bridge, sourdough bread, Alcatraz, and more recently, a lot of million dollar homes. Amongst the largest metros, San Francisco metro has the highest share of million dollar homes in the country at 58%. And not surprisingly, the other two Bay Area metros rank #2 (San Jose) and #3 (Oakland). Within the city of San Francisco itself, more than 63% of homes are valued above the $1 million mark.
To find out where million dollar homes have spread the most in the City by the Bay, we calculated the value for every home in San Francisco between January 2010 and September 2015. We define a million dollar home as any home – regardless of whether it’s listed or not – with a value of $1,000,000 or more. As you can see from the map below, the number of homes worth more than a million dollars has grown exponentially in just five years. (Click here to see and get the embed code for animated map of San Francisco below).

At the start of 2010, there were already several hotspots for million dollar homes in San Francisco. The posh neighborhoods of Nob Hill, Noe Valley, Pacific Heights, Potrero Hill, St. Francis Wood, and the Richmond District had some of the largest concentrations of million dollar homes in 2010. However, there were several neighborhoods where most home values were below the million-dollar mark, including the Sunset, the Mission, SOMA, and the Bayview.

ralph,America’s Best Beer Towns for Celebrating Oktoberfest,Infographics,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/beer-towns/,2015-09-24,"Looking for the best place to celebrate Oktoberfest all year long? Head to Traverse City, MI, Bend, OR, or Fort Collins, CO.; With the arrival of fall comes crisp air, football, and for beer lovers like myself…Oktoberfest! The annual celebration held in Munich attracts millions of revelers who indulge in beer, beer, or more beer (and maybe a bratwurst or two). For those that can’t make it to Bavaria this September (yes, Oktoberfest actually starts in September!), we’ve crunched the numbers to find out which U.S. towns you can get the freshest malt beverage, go on the lengthiest pub crawl, have the widest choice of off-the-shelf suds, or have the highest likelihood of sharing a beer with someone of German ancestry.
To find out where are the best Oktoberfest towns in America, we’ve cranked through the neighborhood amenities data on our site, which comes by way of Yelp, to find out which U.S. metro has the most breweries, bars, and bottle shops per household. We also crunched the Census’ 2013 American Community Survey data to find out which metros have the highest share of persons who self-identified as having primary German ancestry. For this analysis, we looked at all U.S. metros with at least 100,000 people. We then took the average ranking for each metro in each of these four categories — # of breweries per 10,000 households, # of bars per 10,000 households, # of bottle shops per households, and the percent of German Americans — to calculate the Oktoberfest index, standardized to a score of 0-100.
Here’s the top 10 list of metros that rank highest on our Oktoberfest Index. As you can see, the best place to be is in smaller metro areas, where your beer sources are plenty and the homes are cheap. (And if you want to see how all the metros included in our study did, you can download the full dataset here).

Now let’s take a look at how metros fared in each of our four Oktoberfest categories.
Want a Stein of Fresh Beer for Oktoberfest? Look for Bavarian LandscapesOktoberfest revelers hoping to fill their Bierkrug (beer mug) with locally brewed beer should head to U.S. metros that look like the German countryside. Of the top 10 metros with the highest concentration of breweries, most are in places with mountains, cold-winter weather, or pine forests. Bend, OR tops our list with 3.9 breweries per 10,000 households, while Boulder, CO and Burlington, VT round out the top 3 with 3.85 and 2.2 breweries, respectively. The rest of the list also includes Bavarian-like destinations like Fort Collins, Co, Missoula, MT, Flagstaff, AZ, and Coeur d’Alene, ID.

Where Bar Hoppers Have Plenty of Choices for OktoberfestFor those looking to casually celebrate Oktoberfest at local watering holes, the 10 metros with the highest concentration of bars are spread out nicely across the country. Taking the top spot is San Francisco, with 16.5 bars for every 10,000 households, followed by Maui and Reno with about 14 bars each. Traditional party destinations such as New Orleans, Las Vegas, and Myrtle Beach also make the list, while beer-centric Portland, college-town Ithaca, and two Wisconsin metros round out the top 10.

Oktoberfest Homebodies Best off in CaliforniaLooking to stock up on beer and red cups at home? Go check out your neighborhood bottle shop (and depending on where you live, you may refer to this establishment as a liquor store, off license, bottle-o, packie, ABC store, or state store). Homebodies looking to celebrate Oktoberfest from home will be better off in California. Not surprisingly, wine-soaked Napa makes the top of the list with 13.5 shops per 10,000 households, followed by San Francisco, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Santa Rosa, San Diego, and Los Angeles. The only non-California metros that have the most bottle shops include Barnstable, MA, Boulder, CO, and Torrington, CT.

ralph,How Commuting Costs and Utilities Affect Middle-Class Housing Affordability,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/affordability/,2015-09-16,"Middle-class homebuyers in California are the most squeezed when it comes to finding a home within their budget, while those in Ohio have plenty of options.; In the past year, affordability for homebuyers has fallen in 89 of the 100 largest housing markets thanks to rising home prices and stagnant income growth in many metros. We’ve also found a polarizing trend in affordability: the least affordable markets have become even less affordable for homebuyers over the past year, while the most affordable markets have remained relatively stable. However, mortgage payments, property taxes and insurance aren’t the only factors affecting housing affordability. The cost of commuting and utilities can also play a big role depending on where you live. For example, households living in metros with cold winters and hot summers might have larger utility bills, and those living in low-density, sprawling metros might have to spend more time and gas driving around town. When we took these two non-housing essential costs into account, we found that some of the most affordable markets don’t look that cheap anymore.
To paint a more accurate picture of housing affordability across the country, we first measured how much of a middle-class household’s monthly income would be spent on the monthly mortgage payment if they bought the median-priced home today in the 100 largest U.S. metros. We assumed a 30-year fixed-rate loan at 4% interest rate, and included both property taxes and insurance into our calculations. The median-priced home for each metro was based on all the for-sale listings on Trulia in August 2015. To calculate utility costs, we used data from the 2013 American Community Survey (ACS) on the median monthly household expenditure on electricity, gas, and water for each of the 100 largest U.S. metros. To calculate commuting costs, we also used 2013 ACS data to calculate the median household commute time to work for each metro. We then transformed commute time into a monthly dollar amount by assuming a $7 per hour operating cost ($3.50 per gallon, 20 miles per gallon average, and 40 miles per hour average speed) plus 25% of the local median hourly wage. We excluded commute time for household members that used non-automobile modes for their commute (e.g., trains and subways). Finally, to find out how utilities and commuting costs affect affordability, we calculated the monthly share of the median household’s income spent on all three essentials. Using this methodology, here are the most and least affordable places to live.


Now, let’s dive into each of these costs and how they affect a market’s affordability to middle-class homebuyers.
Housing Most Affordable in Ohio, Least in California 
The Midwest is the most affordable place to be, especially in Ohio. Middle-class homebuyers in Akron, Dayton, Cleveland, and Toledo can get away with paying less than 20% of their monthly income on mortgage payments on a median priced home. To put this into context, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development considers housing expenditures greater than 31% of your incoming as unaffordable. What’s even better, homebuyers in most top 10 most affordable housing markets are actually spending even less of their income on housing since last year. And in market where there was an increase, the share of income spent on housing has jumped by no more than 0.7 percentage points.

On the other hand, California continues to be a tough housing market for middle-class homebuyers. Seven of the 10 least affordable housing markets are located in the golden state, with Miami, Fairfield County, and Honolulu being the only non-California metros to make the list. In these least affordable markets, middle-class households would need to spend at least 42% of their monthly income to buy the median priced home. But in pricey San Francisco, that number jumps to an incredible 77% of income. San Jose, Miami, Orange County, San Diego, and Los Angeles follow with middle-class homebuyers needing to fork over at least 50% of their monthly income on housing

Furthermore, affordability isn’t getting any better in the most expensive markets either. Compared to last year, middle-class homebuyers in each these 10 metros will need to spend more of their income on housing if they bought a median priced home. Most notably in San Francisco and Miami, the share of income needed to be spent on housing has jumped more than 15 percentage points. What’s more, we found a strong positive relationship between housing affordability in September 2014 and the year-over-year change in the share of income spent on housing. In other words, the most expensive markets are getting even more expensive, and the least expensive have remained idle.

Non-Essential Housing Costs Can Add Up, Especially in the Cheapest of Housing Markets 
When it comes to housing, homebuyers need to consider other expenses beyond their mortgage, property tax, and insurance payments. What we’ve found might surprise you: some of the most affordable metros might not seem so affordable when taking into account the costs of commuting and utilities. For example, in five of the 10 metros with the highest share of income spent on commuting and utilities, middle-class homebuyer can actually purchase a median-price home and spend less than 31% of their monthly income on housing. But when taking into account commuting and utility costs, the share of income spent on housing and these non-housing essentials jumps significantly. For example, middle-class homebuyers in Detroit and Birmingham could spend less than 20% of their monthly income on housing if they bought a median priced home. However, the share of income jumps to nearly 40% when we factor in the median commuting and utility cost. In these two metros, the median households spend between 15-17% of their income towards non-housing essentials. Likewise in affordable Houston, the share of income spent on housing by middle-class homebuyers is a small-ish 34.9%, but jumps to over 50% when factoring in these other costs. A few expensive housing markets also make the list the too, with middle-class households in Los Angeles and Miami also spending between 15-17% of their income on non-housing essentials. What’s interesting is that in these two metros, much of the non-housing essential costs come in the form of commuting expenses (10.8% and 11.5%).

On the flipside, Fairfield County, San Francisco, and San Jose are the three metros where middle-class homebuyers will spend the least amount of their income on non-housing essentials –spending less than 10% of their income on commuting and utility costs. What’s also surprising about this list is that these three metros, along with Ventura County, also make the least affordable list when we add together the cost of housing, commuting and utilities. In other words, some of what homebuyers lose in affordability are made up by cheaper commuting and utility costs.

All in all, these housing markets have a few things in common. They tend to be located in areas connected to extensive public transit systems, like San Francisco, Long Island, and Washington, DC, or are in areas with a moderate climates, such as San Jose, Ventura County, and Denver. In fact, this relationship holds up quite strongly amongst the largest 100 metros – areas that are more expensive tend to have lower commuting and utility costs, and less expensive metros tend to have higher costs. While some of this relationship is driven by the fact that households in expensive markets tend to have higher incomes, these are also other more practical reasons. Larger, more expensive markets tend to also have better access to public transportation and also tend to be in areas with a milder climate, such as California and Florida.

The moral of the story is that middle-class homebuyers should consider not just the price of a prospective home, but also other costs associated with the home’s location. After all, location, location, location affects not just the cost of the home itself, but also the how far one must commute and spend on heating, cooling, and water expenses. The good news for homebuyers in expensive housing markets is that the cost of pricier homes is somewhat balanced out by cheaper non-housing essentials."
ralph,America’s Fastest Moving Markets Finally Slowing Down,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/fast-moving-markets-aug2015/,2015-08-26,"Homes are going especially quickly in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Denver, and Salt Lake City, but there are finally signs of a cool-off.; After years of tight inventory and large price gains in several major housing markets, home buyers can breathe a sigh of relief — we’re now seeing early signs of a slowdown. But what does this mean for home buyers?
To find out, we first calculated how long homes are staying on the market by measuring the share of homes for sale on Trulia over a two-month period. We looked at homes listed on June 17, then counted how many were still for sale on August 17. Faster-moving markets had a lower percentage of homes still on the market after two months, while slower-moving markets had a higher percentage.
Our two-month measure is similar to a common housing statistic: days on market (DOM). In general, housing markets with more inventory and fewer buyers will have a higher share of for-sale homes remaining on the market after two months and a higher median DOM. But we prefer our two-month measure over the widely watched DOM as a way to determine how quickly homes are moving in a market. Why? We think DOM is potentially misleading. If lots of new inventory suddenly lands on the market, then median DOM could fall thanks to all those newly listed homes. Thus, a low median DOM might indicate that buyers are snapping up homes quickly, so homes aren’t staying on the market long (a seller’s market). But it could also signal that a lot of new inventory has just come onto the market (a buyer’s market). As a result, it’s difficult to decipher what’s really going on based on DOM alone.
Home Sales Moving Slightly Slower in 2015 Across All Price Tiers
Nationally, 63% of homes listed for sale on June 17 were still on the market on August 17, which is up a bit from 61% for the same period last year. And it turns out homes across all price tiers have slowed about the same. To see this, we evenly divided all homes in each of the 100 largest U.S. metros into three price tiers based on what’s considered high-end, mid-range, and low-end locally.
Home sales in all three tiers slowed 2-3 percentage points compared with a year ago. The share of low-price and mid-priced homes still on the market after two months increased 2 percentage points, compared with a 3-point increase for high-tier homes. As always though, the national trend hides big differences from one local market to another. In many metros, the sales pace is quickening, while slowing in others.

Affordability Plays Role in California Slowdown and Southern Pickup
California continues to reign as the state with the fastest moving markets with San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, San Diego, and Orange County making the top 10 list of America’s fastest moving housing markets. In fact, less than 34% of the homes for sale in the top three San Francisco Bay Area metros remained on the market after two months. But the news isn’t all bad for California home buyers. The percentage of homes still on the market after two months has increased slightly over the past year. Meanwhile, Seattle, Salt Lake City, and North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, FL are gaining ground, having decreased between 4-7 percentage points from a year ago.

Note: Among the 100 largest U.S. metros. The two-month shares and the difference are rounded to the nearest percentage point, and the difference was calculated before rounding; therefore, the rounded difference might not equal the difference between the rounded shares. 
But housing markets in the South, which have sped up the most year-over-year, aren’t the fastest moving. The share of homes for sale in Winston–Salem, NC, which ranks #23 on the list, still on the market after two months dropped 9 percentage points from 67% in August 2014 to 58% in August 2015. Greensboro, NC and North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, FL sped up at a similar pace, dropping 8 percentage points, followed by Charlotte, NC, and Cape Coral–Fort Myers, FL, which dropped 7 and 6 percentage points each.
So what drives a fast moving market? As with our previous findings, increases in home prices are strongly correlated with the share of homes on the market after two months.

However, affordability may be starting to play a role in the priciest markets. Of the 50 most expensive housing markets, those with fewer homes for sale that are affordable to the middle class in 2014 tended to experience a slowdown. In other words, home buyers, no matter how competitive the market is, have a limit. When the stock of cheaper homes dries up, not every buyer is able to up their budget and put offers on homes in a higher price tier. So some may delay buying a home, which leads to existing homes sitting on the market a tad longer. Still, homes in these expensive markets are moving faster than other less expensive metros.

America’s Heartland: Where First-Time Home Buyers Can Take Their Time
Nationally, and in 89 of the 100 largest metro areas, low-tier homes move faster than all other homes. But first-time home buyers in the Midwest and South can take their time because low-tier homes there actually move slower than the market as a whole. To see this, we evenly divided all homes in each of the 100 largest U.S. metros into three price tiers and compared how fast the lowest tier moved compared to the market as a whole.

Detroit tops the list, where entry-level homes on average move 4 percentage points slower than the rest of the market. Kansas City, MO, and New Orleans both have about 3 percent more entry-level homes are on the market after two months. And that number is two percent greater in Pittsburgh, PA. There is just a one-percentage point advantage in the other six metros that round out our top 10 list of markets where entry-level homes are easier to buy.
Winter is Coming: Relief in Sight for Some Home Buyers
For home buyers in some of the nation’s most competitive housing market, waiting to buy in the winter just might pay off. To figure out whether seasonality plays a role in how fast markets move, we calculated how long homes stay on the market in the summer versus the winter. As it turns out, those living in five of the fastest moving markets this summer also top the list of metros with the largest winter-to-summer change in the share of homes still on the market after two month. For example, in pricey San Francisco and Oakland, CA, the pace of sales increased by 19% and 17% (proportion increase, not percentage points!) between winter and summer over the past three years. In Cambridge, MA, Seattle, WA, and North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, FL, the increase is between 12% and 14%. So home buyers who were not able to close on the home of their dreams in the fastest moving markets this summer might have better luck come winter.

Note: Among the 100 largest U.S. metros. The two-month shares and the difference are rounded to the nearest percentage point, and the difference was calculated before rounding; therefore, the rounded difference might not equal the difference between the rounded shares. 
Just as we found earlier this year, the fastest moving markets were those that had the largest year-over-year price gains. San Francisco and Oakland, which have a greater winter-summer differential, also tend to have larger swings between winter and summer prices. To see this relationship, we calculated the average seasonal increase in median asking price between winter and summer, and then compared it to the winter-to-summer differential in the share of homes on market after two months. As it turns out, there is a moderate and negative relationship between the two – which means markets that see larger seasonal price spikes tend to move proportionally faster during the summer.

Consolation Relief For First-Time Home Buyers
All of this should be taken as consolatory news for first-time home buyers. In our last two fastest moving market reports, we found that not only were for-sale homes moving faster than the year before, but that cheaper homes moved much faster than expensive homes — and had been increasing in speed year-over-year.
That story has changed course this summer. Compared to last year, a larger share of homes are staying on the market after two months. Even the fastest moving markets have slowed down somewhat. Moreover, in a handful of markets, first-time home buyers looking for entry-level homes can actually take their time to find their dream home. So what this means for first-time home buyers is that they can be cautiously optimistic that normality may be creeping in on what has been an otherwise difficult marketplace over the past two years."
ralph,The Debt of Wrath: Do Student Loans Affect Saving for a Home?,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/millennial-down-payment/,2015-07-08,"In less expensive housing markets, young millennials saving up for a 20% down payment will actually be hindered by a college degree because of student debt payments. But in the most expensive markets, only those with a college degree will be able to make enough to save up for a home within their lifetime.; To go to college, or not to go? That is a question many millennials ask themselves. A college degree undeniably comes with perks, including better long-term job prospects and higher lifetime earnings. But many millennials who get a college degree must pay back student loans, making it more difficult to save for a down payment in the short run.
So why does this matter? Well, saving for a down payment is one of the biggest obstacles to homeownership. In fact, according to a recent Trulia survey*, 30% of 25-30 year olds in the U.S. said that they are currently trying to save for a down payment in the next two years. Moreover, there’s been much discussion about the impact of student loan debt on the ability of recent graduates to save for a down payment and buy a home.
So the real question is – if owning a home is part of your personal American Dream, is a college degree a necessary pre-cursor to being able to afford a down payment and securing the keys? The answer depends on where you want to buy a home.
Can You Really Save Up for a Down Payment?
A common approach to figuring out how long it will take to save for a down payment to buy a home is to calculate a 20% down payment (the ideal amount home buyers should put down) using the median housing price of a metro area, and assume that a would-be homebuyer is saving 10% of what they make each year (for which we’ll use the annual median household income). To get the number of years that it will take for a household to save for a home, you then divide the 20% down payment by the amount saved each year.
So, if the median house is priced at $200,000 and the median household income is $50,000, it would take eight years for the median household to save for a down payment.
Median Priced Home:
$200,000
20% Down Payment on Median Priced Home:
20% x $200,000 = $40,000
Median Annual Income:
$50,000
10% of Income Saved Each Year:
10% x $50,000 = $5,000
# of Years Required to Save Down Payment:
$40,000 / $5,000 = 8 Years
However, eight years isn’t really an accurate estimate of how long it will take to save for a down payment because both home prices and household income can change during those eight years. For example, if you’re not getting a raise at the same rate at which home prices are rising, it will take longer to save for a down payment and vice versa. Additionally, this calculation doesn’t factor in student debt repayment, which is one obstacle to homeownership for college-educated millennials. The average college-educated American has about $26,000 in student loan debt, which translates into an average monthly payment of about $280 per month on a 10-year repayment plan. Moreover, approximately 30% of young millennial households have a 4-year college degree and 70% do not.
A more accurate method (which we used here in this study) is to estimate how much home prices and household income change over time, and calculate the point in time at which cumulative household savings equals the down payment required at that future time period. This calculation also factors in student debt repayment and how that takes away from a household’s saving power.
To estimate how much the required down payment will grow over time, we used the 20-year Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) home price growth rate for each of the 100 largest U.S. metros given the current median listing home prices on Trulia. For household income growth, we used data from the Census’ 2013 American Community Survey (ACS) to identify the difference in income between fully-employed 25-30 year olds and 45-50 years olds with and without a college degree to extrapolate how much money each group is expected to make over time. Doing so takes into account the fact that households tend see the largest increase in income over this 20-year period. We then assume a 20% down payment requirement and 10% savings rate for each group. For the college-educated group, we assume that they’ve signed up for a 10-year repayment plan on their student loans and subtracted the average monthly student loan payment ($280) from their savings for the first 120 months. Last, we identify the specific month in the future at which each group – those with and without college degrees — has saved up enough for a 20% down payment on a median priced home in their respective housing market.
Where You Can Save for a Down Payment Fast
First, the good news: there are many housing markets in the U.S. where a Millennial will be able to make enough money to save for a down payment in a reasonable time, regardless of whether they hold a college degree. Topping the list is Detroit, where a 25-30 year old could save for a down payment in 4.1 years with a college degree and 5.3 years without. Dominating the rest of the list are metros in Ohio where would-be homeowners in Akron, Dayton, Cleveland and Toledo can save for a down payment in six years or less.

Where You Can Save Faster Without a College Degree
What’s more is that in several of these housing markets, millennial households without a college degree can actually save for a down payment faster than college-educated households. For example, in metros like Columbia, El Paso and Las Vegas, 25-30 year old households without a college degree will be able to save for a down payment at least a year and a half faster than those with a college degree.

How is this possible? Two reasons. First, the boost in income that you get for having a college degree in these metros is small. Second, households with college degrees typically have student loan payments, which hinder their ability to save for a down payment.

Want To Be A California Homeowner? Go To College!
Next the bad news: there are several housing markets where a college degree is the ticket to saving for a 20% down payment, and nearly all of them are in California.
And even households with a college degree will start to show gray hairs by the time they’ve saved up enough to buy a home. For example, it will take 29.4 years for a 25-30 year old household to save up a 20% down payment on a median priced home in San Francisco, 18.8 years in Los Angeles, 18.5 years in Orange County and 17.7 years in San Diego and San Jose.

The news gets even worse for those that don’t have a college degree. In pricey San Francisco, saving up for a 20% down payment is impossible. Why? Because prices are high and rising fast, so the monthly increase for the required down payment outpaces the increase in the total monthly household savings during a typical lifespan. And in other California metros, young millennials without college degree will be old and gray (or possibly in the grave) by the time they’ve saved enough for a 20% down payment – 45.4 years in San Jose, 39.9 years in Los Angeles, 32.3 years in Orange County, 29.0 years in San Diego, 27.3 years in Oakland and 22.9 years in Ventura County.

No College Degree? Try a 10% Down Payment.
Just because you don’t have a college degree, doesn’t mean you should completely abandon your dreams of homeownership. While a 20% down payment is the “traditional” amount that allows borrowers to avoid costly mortgage insurance, it is not uncommon for homebuyers to put 10% down (however, we recommend putting down as large of a down payment as you can afford). In the long run, putting 20% down will save you money, but putting 10% down can get you into a home in less than half the time. How is this possible? Because price appreciation outpaces income growth for that cohort, so the required down payment for a home increases faster than the marginal increase in monthly savings contributions.
For example, millennials without a college degree in San Francisco will actually be able to save for a 10% down payment in 28.5 years, compared to not being able to save for a 20% down payment ever. And in other expensive metros, the number of years to save for a down payment is cut by more than half. In pricey San Jose, the time is cut from 45.4 years to just 15.4; in Los Angeles it drops from 39.9 to 12.8 years; Orange County drops from 32.3 to 11.6 years and San Diego moves from 29.0 to only 11.8 years.

To recap, student loans payments temporarily hinder households saving for a down payment. But because college-educated households earn more in the long-run, a college degree is about the only way to save for a down payment in some of the most expensive markets. However, households without a household degree should fear not – saving up for a 10% down payment is disproportionally faster because of higher appreciation in house prices relative to income during the additional years of saving for 20% down
METHODOLOGY
To estimate how a college degree impacts the ability to save for a down payment, we take a three step-approach:
(1) Estimate income, income growth, and monthly savings for each month into the future.
We use 2013 ACS data on annual median incomes for households headed by 25-30 year olds with and without a college degree for each of the largest 100 metropolitan areas. Next, we use the median annual income of households headed by 45-50 year olds with and without college degrees to project household income growth for each cohort. In addition, we assume a 2% inflation-adjusted increase in pay, and a generous savings account interest rate of 1%. Doing so takes into account the fact that household income tend to increase over time, both because of inflation but also because of life-cycle effects. We then assume each household saves 10% of their monthly income for a down payment, but subtract the average student loan payment of $280 from the college-educated cohort’s savings for the first 10 years (estimated payment on the average student loan debt is available here: https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action).
(2) Estimate median prices, price growth, and the estimated down payment for each month into the future.
We estimate the 20% down payment on the median priced home for each metro in each month. To do this, we use the FHFA 20-year growth rate to the June 2015 median house price listing on Trulia for each metro weighted by a 2% inflation rate. Doing so takes into account the fact that house prices change during the period in which a household is saving for a down payment.
(3) Estimate the month in the future when each cohort can buy a home.
We calculate the month in time when cumulative monthly household savings equals the required 20% down payment for each cohort, and then convert the number of months into a yearly figure. We calculate the number of years to save for a 10% down payment in similar manner.
* This survey was conducted online within the United States between May 26th and 28th, 2015 among 2,026 adults (aged 18 and over) by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia via its Quick Query omnibus product. Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online.
All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, the words “margin of error” are avoided as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal.
Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in our panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated"
ralph,Gayborhood Watch: How Home Prices Have Changed in America’s Gayest Neighborhoods,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/gayborhood-watch/,2015-06-10,"Of the gayest neighborhoods in America, most are more expensive than other neighborhoods in their metro area, but some have grown even more expensive than others.; Three years ago, we explored how the housing market fared in the gayest neighborhoods across the country. One of the most interesting findings from that report was that gay men tended to live in more expensive ZIP codes than gay women, even when looking at ZIPs within the same metro. In honor of Gay Pride this year, we wanted to revisit these neighborhoods and find out what’s changed since 2012.
To do this, we calculated the share of households that are same-sex male couples and same-sex female couples in every ZIP code in America using the 2010 Census (see note below on how we did this). Focusing on just the top 10 ZIPs with the highest concentration of same-sex male and same-sex female couples, we then calculated the median price per foot of homes for sale in each ZIP code on Trulia as of June 1, 2015 and compared it to June 1, 2012 to find out how prices have changed, both over time and relative to their metropolitan area.
Home Prices Higher and Growing Faster Where Gay Men Live
In June of 2012, homes in gay men neighborhoods cost $188 per square foot, which is $55 more expensive than in gay women neighborhoods. Since then, gay men neighborhoods have gone on a tear – becoming $81 per square foot more expensive.
Over the last three years, home prices in gay men neighborhoods have grown by an average of 23%. Of course, this figures mask changes in individual neighborhoods, so here’s a look at where prices have risen the most.

Home Price Growth Outpaces Metro Area Where Gay Women Live
Several gayborhoods are located in expensive metros that have also experienced sharp price gains in the last few years, such as San Francisco and Boston. So it could be that rising home prices in these neighborhoods are driven by price changes in their respective housing market, rather than the demand to live in gayborhoods themselves. To tease out these neighborhood-level effects, we’ve compared prices in these gayborhoods with their respective metro areas.
As it turns out, home prices in almost all of the gayborhoods that we look at in this study are more expensive than their metros as a whole. For example, homes in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco cost $948 per square foot – which is 34% more expensive than the San Francisco metro area ($705 per square foot), while places like West Hollywood, CA and Provincetown, MA are 123% and 119% more expensive, respectively. The only gayborhood that isn’t more expensive than its respective metro is Guerneville, north of San Francisco, CA, which is only 2% cheaper per square foot than its metro area.

Interestingly, when we compare price growth in these neighborhoods to their metro area, gay women neighborhoods have outperformed their gay men neighborhood counterparts. Even though neighborhoods with the most gay men are more expensive, a larger number of gay women neighborhoods (six) have outpaced their metro areas than gay men neighborhoods (two). And not only have prices in more gay women neighborhoods grown faster than their metro, they have grown by a larger amount.
For example, prices in gay women neighborhoods like Avondale Estates in Atlanta, Jamaica Plain in Boston, and Northampton in West Massachusetts have grown 35%, 28%, and 11% points faster than their metro area. On the other hand, the top two fastest growing gay men neighborhoods have only grown 13% (Palm Springs, CA) and 5% (Rehoboth Beach, DE) points faster than their metro, and the third (Noe Valley / Glen Park / Diamond Heights, San Francisco, CA) actually lost one percentage point.

So why the discrepancy in price growth between same-sex male and female neighborhoods? A couple of reasons. First, the top gay men neighborhoods are places where prices were already high relative to their metros, and thus were not hit as hard during the housing crash as other less expensive neighborhoods within their respective metros. Second, gay women couples are 2.4X as likely to have children than gay men couples, so it could be that gay women seek up-and-coming neighborhoods with good schools to raise their children. Nonetheless, all of these neighborhoods are likely to be full of pride during the month of June, and not just because of strong price gains.
(The fine print: The Census doesn’t ask sexual orientation, of course, so the only way to measure gay neighborhoods is based on where couples live. The Census data requires some corrections and adjustments, described here. Finally, ZIP codes don’t line up perfectly with neighborhoods, but we did our best to use the closest neighborhood names that correspond to the ZIP codes in our analysis.)"
ralph,Pads for Grads: Where the Newly Educated Can Afford Rent,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/pads-for-grads/,2015-05-20,"Of the largest 25 largest rental markets, less than 19% of all rental listings on the market are affordable for recent college graduates. The most affordable places to live for recent grads include St. Louis, Dallas, and Houston, while the least affordable are Portland, Riverside, and Orange County.; School is (nearly) out for the summer. That means millions of newly-minted college graduates will strike out on their own to find a job and place to live. Here at Trulia, we’re experts in the latter, so we’ve set out to help new grads find areas where they can afford to rent and still have some money left over to pay back their student loans.
We measure graduate affordability as the share of rental homes on Trulia, as of May 7, 2015, that are within reach of an employed, college graduate between the ages of 22 and 25. Our standard is whether the total monthly payment, including rental payment and insurance, is less than 31% of the metro area’s median income for recent grads. We calculate affordability based on the local median graduate income and rents for the 25 largest rental markets in the US. Thus, what we consider affordable for a graduate varies from market to market.
For instance, in metro Atlanta, the median salary for a new grad is $25,571 per year. If you’re only making this much money, then you can only rent homes that cost less than $661 per month based on the 31% guideline. Sadly, this means just 8.7% of the homes for rent in Atlanta (those listed for less than $661) are within reach.
Want To Pay Less In Rent? Move Inland
Generally, the picture isn’t pretty for recent grads who want to find an affordable place on their own. Those who head to the Midwest and Southern states can save the most on rent. But even in St. Louis, which tops the list of most affordable metros for new grads, just 18.6% of rental units are affordable. And it’s all downhill from there: with the next most affordable areas having less than 15% of affordable rental units. The good news is, you would need no more than one roommate to make the median rental unit affordable in each of five least expensive metros for grads.

Go West Young Grad? Only If You Can Pay More
If you plan to head to the West Coast after graduation, then you might want to take a crash course in sticker shock.  Less than 1% of all rental units in the bottom five are affordable, and almost all are in expensive California markets. Portland, OR ranks the least affordable with 0.1% of units affordable, followed by Riverside-San Bernardino, CA (0.2%) Orange County, CA (0.2%), Miami, FL (0.4%) and, San Diego, CA (0.4%).
So what’s a grad to do? Although it’s an exciting prospect to get a place of your own right out of college, the cost of doing so may be large. For those not wanting to live with Mom and Dad, there are two options: spend time searching for the few affordable units that are out there (Trulia can help out with that!), or find roommates.
To help with the latter, we’ve crunched the numbers to find out how many roommates a recent grad would need to afford rent, and whether that means sharing a bedroom. In the five least affordable rental markets, a recent grad would need at least two roommates to make the median rental unit affordable, and in Riverside-San Bernardino, CA, that number jumps to three. In all of the five least affordable markets except Riverside-San Bernardino, CA, this means that two individuals would need to share a room, just like during freshman year!

SF-DC-NY: How Much Do You Really Need To Earn To Rent?
Want to live like a young professional and not like a fresh-faced graduate? You might want to think twice about moving to a high-wage metro. For recent college graduates looking to live comfortably, moving to a metro where the young and educated earn the most might be a tempting offer. After all, in San Francisco, Washington, DC, and New York, the starting salaries for recent graduates aren’t too far off from salaries of more experienced workers in other metros. These areas also have high rates of employment. So why not pack up and move to The City by the Bay, The District, or The Big Apple? Two words: high rents.
Many of the metros that pay the highest salaries also come with hefty rental price tags. Here’s a look at how grad salaries stack up to the salaries needed to afford median rents. So take notice recent grads, bigger isn’t always better – ‘cause that big salary may not seem so big after you start writing out that monthly rent check.

The Cliff’s Notes Of Rental Affordability
The lesson here for recent grads is that although it may be tempting to seek out metros with the highest wages, doing so may not necessarily lead to a better quality of life because these metros also have high rents.
Recent grads need to balance both wages and rents, so places like St. Louis, Dallas, and Houston, fit the bill for affordability. Although the percent of units in these areas that are affordable is under 19%, finding just one roommate is enough to make the median priced rental unit affordable. However, in places like Portland and Southern California, not only are affordable units few and far between, but it takes living in dorm-like quarters to make the median priced rental unit affordable."
ralph,Where HOA Fees Make Renting Cheaper Than Buying a Home,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/rent-vs-buy-spring-2015/,2015-05-13,"Nationally, buying with a traditional 20% down payment and 30-year mortgage is 35% cheaper than renting. But homeowner association (HOA) fees can make the decision more difficult in metro New York and Honolulu.; Homeownership remains cheaper than renting in all 100 largest U.S. metro areas. In fact, buying is 35% cheaper than renting now, compared with 33% cheaper one year ago. Paradoxically, home price growth nationally has outpaced rents over the past year. So what gives? Two things. First, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate has fallen from 4.5% in 2014 to 3.87% today (as of April 15). Second, the 3.9% home price gain wasn’t much larger than the 3.7% gain in rents. In the past year, these two trends have made homeownership even more affordable compared with renting.
Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy Report assumes a traditional 30-year fixed rate mortgage with a 20% down payment. But for those looking to buy a home, apartment, or condo with homeowner association (HOA) fees, the extra cost could make renting a more attractive option.
Our method for calculating the total costs of buying and renting follows these steps:
We use our quality-adjusted measure of home prices and rents, which allows an apples-to-apples comparison between rental and owner-occupied housing units. For this report, we looked at all the homes listed on Trulia for rent or sale in March 2015.
We calculate the initial total monthly costs of owning and renting, including mortgage payments, maintenance, insurance, and taxes. We make a separate calculation that factors HOA fees into the rent vs. buy equation.
We calculate the future total monthly costs of owning and renting, taking into account expected price and rent appreciation, as well as projected inflation.
We factor in one-time costs and proceeds, including closing costs, down payment, sale proceeds, and security deposits.
We calculate net present value, which tells us the opportunity cost of using money to buy a house instead of investing it. Net present value is the worth in today’s dollars of a future stream of payments and proceeds, taking into account expected interest rates.
To compare the costs of owning and renting, we assume buyers get a 3.87% mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan with 20% down; itemize their federal tax deductions and are in the 25% tax bracket; and will stay in their home for seven years. Under these assumptions, buying is 35% cheaper than renting nationwide, considering all costs and proceeds from buying or renting over the seven-year period. You can read our methodology here.
The interactive Rent vs. Buy map shows how the math changes under alternative assumptions for mortgage rates, income tax brackets, number of years in the home, and HOA fees, if any. To estimate HOA costs, we combed through Trulia’s for-sale listings and calculated the median homeowner’s fee for each of the 100 largest metro areas.
Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy Calculator lets you compare renting and buying costs using whatever assumptions about prices, rents, and other factors you want, including HOA fees. It uses the same math that powers our interactive map and this report.
Tougher Call between Renting and Buying in Honolulu and California
While homeownership is 35% cheaper than renting nationwide, the gap differs vastly across metros, largely because each market has its own typical prices and rents, as well as distinct patterns in property taxes and home-price appreciation. Taking all these factors into account, buying a home ranges from being 16% cheaper than renting in Honolulu to being 55% cheaper in Sarasota, FL.
Generally, it’s a closer call in California and an easier call in the South. What’s more, in seven of the 10 housing markets where buying has the smallest edge over renting, the buying advantage actually increased in the past year. On the other end of the spectrum, the buying advantage widened in six of the 10 markets where buying has the biggest edge.

Note: Negative numbers mean that buying costs less than renting. For example, buying a home in New Orleans is 52% cheaper than renting in 2015. Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy calculation assumes a 3.87% 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 20% down payment, itemizing tax deductions at the 25% bracket, and staying seven years in the home. Year-over-year differences are rounded to the nearest percentage point, and the difference was calculated before rounding; therefore, the rounded difference might not equal the difference between the rounded shares.  Click here to download the full Rent vs. Buy cost considerations for the 100 largest U.S. metros.
HOA Fees Can Make a Big Difference in the Rent vs. Buy Decision
If you are a homeowner association member, you need to factor in your HOA fee into your monthly housing costs. What these fees cover varies, but they can include everything from landscaping and maintaining public spaces to utilities and cable TV. The fee amounts also vary and, in some areas, you might have to pay a lot.
The New York and Honolulu metropolitan areas top the list of markets with the most expensive HOA fees, with medians of $575 and $438 per month respectively. Fort Myers, FL, Riverside, CA, and Miami, FL round out the top five with median HOA fees between $310 and $356. In these high-fee markets, HOA costs can make a significant difference in whether it’s better to rent or buy.

To understand how much difference these costs make, we’ve factored in the median HOA fee for each of the 100 largest metros in our rent vs. buy analysis. If you want to know how much a homeowner fee on a specific property will affect your housing costs, Trulia’s rent vs. buy calculator allows you to plug in the fee amount in the advanced settings.
When we factor in the median HOA fee, the buying advantage almost disappears in some markets. In the New York metro area, buying a home becomes just 4% cheaper than renting, compared with 27% cheaper without the fee. And in the Honolulu metro, renting actually enjoys a 1% advantage when HOA fees are considered.
Without those fees, buying is 16% cheaper than renting. In some other markets, even though it’s still cheaper to buy a home with HOA fees than to rent, the swing can be large. For example, Melbourne, FL’s median HOA fee of $266 per month on a median-price house makes buying there 23% cheaper than renting, a swing of 22 percentage points from 45% cheaper without the fee. Other metros with similar swings include Youngstown, OH (48% vs. 28%), Fort Myers, FL (54% vs. 34%), and Riverside, CA (34% vs. 16%).

By contrast, metros like Baton Rouge, LA and Oklahoma City, OK—where the median HOA fee will set you back only $30 and $22 per month respectively—are a bargain compared with New York and Honolulu. Furthermore, HOA fees in those areas are relatively cheap relative to median house prices, so they hardly affect the renting vs. buying calculation. In places where buying is the best deal even with HOA fees, the added monthly costs reduce the buying advantage by just 1-2 percentage points.

To see how much HOA fees add to your monthly mortgage costs, we’ve compared the median monthly mortgage payment with the median fee in the five lowest and highest HOA markets. In markets with the highest HOA fees, the effect is substantial. In Honolulu, the extra hit is 19% and, in Fort Myers, FL, a whopping 50%. But, in markets with the lowest HOA fees, the change is slight. HOA fees add just 2% to your monthly mortgage payment in Sacramento, CA, and just 5% in Little Rock, AR, Indianapolis, IN, and Oklahoma City, OK.

Furthermore, it’s not hard to come up with plausible scenarios in which HOA fees help make buying cost more than renting. Suppose a homebuyer wants to buy a condo with HOA fees. If this buyer is not itemizing tax deductions, only stays put for five years, and qualifies only for a 4.5% mortgage rate, then buying ends up costing more than renting in 29 of the 100 largest metros.
Those 29 metros include not only pricey coastal markets, but also in markets like Madison, WI, Milwaukee, WI, and Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN. In this scenario, buying costs 28% more than renting in New York City and 41% more expensive in Honolulu. So the moral of the story is: A condo might be within reach of most first-time homebuyers, but when you take HOA fees into account, it may make renting cheaper than buying.
Still, at the end of the day, if your dream home comes with HOA fees, it isn’t necessarily a deal breaker. Considering that some HOA fees bundle expenses you’d have to pay anyway, such as garbage, water, sewer, and building maintenance, the HOA fee could turn out to be a good deal. So when considering a home with HOA fees, be sure to find out exactly what those fees cover and factor it in to your overall housing budget.
Note: the detailed methodology and assumptions behind our Rent Vs. Buy model are here. Additionally, for our comparison of HOA fees, we used the median HOA fee of all properties in metro listed on Trulia in 2014."
ralph,America’s Most Paw-some Rental Markets for Pet Owners,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/pet-rental-markets/,2015-04-30,"For renters with pets, finding a place to live can be tough, but by no means impossible. Overall, San Francisco is the most pet-friendly metro, while Dallas has the highest percentage of rental listings that allow pets, and San Diego has the highest concentration of pet stores and services. Washington, DC, is the most expensive, with sky-high pet deposits, pet fees, and pet rents.; Dogs may be man’s best friend, but they’re not necessarily your landlord’s. Nor are cats. If you’re a renter with a pet, one of the biggest challenges is finding a place to live. May is National Pet Month, so we’ve set out to find rental markets where your furry friend is as welcome as you are.
San Francisco Opens Up the Golden Gate for Pet Owners
To find America’s most pet-friendly places to live among the 25 largest rental markets, we’ve looked at several factors and combined them into a single ranking:
Most Pet-Friendly Landlords: Since finding an apartment that allows pets is crucial, we combed through all the listings on Trulia Rentals to see which market has the percentage of rental listings that allow cats, small dogs, or large dogs.
Least Expensive Pet Fees: Another pain point for pet-owning renters are all the added fees that landlords charge for Fido or Whiskers. So to figure out how much extra rent you’ll need to pay, we also calculated the average pet deposit, pet fee, and pet rent in each market using the listings on Trulia Rental.
High Concentration of Pet Stores and Services: Lastly, we used Trulia’s neighborhood amenity map to see which rental markets have the highest concentration of pet store or services, including vets, groomers, and dog walkers.
Turns out, pets will leave their hearts in San Francisco. Of the 25 largest rental markets, the City by the Bay tops the list, thanks to plenty of rentals that allow pets, low pet fees, and plenty of pet stores and services. But San Francisco isn’t the West’s only metro that’s gone to the dogs … and cats. Seattle, Denver, Oakland, and Portland, OR, round out the list of the top five cities for pets. The next five pet-friendly metros include four in other regions. Chicago, St. Louis, New York, and Dallas consistently rank high for each of our pet-positive measures. However, on any given measure, there’s lots of variation. Below is our overall ranking of metros from most to least pet friendly, taking all measures into account. In the rest of this post, we’ll show you the rankings for each of our seven pro-pet qualities.

Cats vs. Dogs: Landlords Friendlier to Cats
Nationally, landlords would rather hear a meow than a woof. Among the 25 largest rental markets, 20% of rentals explicitly allow cats, slightly more than the 18% that allow small dogs. Unfortunately, if you’ve got a St. Bernard or a Great Dane, you’re barking up the wrong tree: Nationwide, just 4% of rental listings say your big dog is welcome.
When we look at individual markets, Dallas comes out on top for rentals that allow cats and dogs of all sizes. Since 2013, over 60% of Trulia’s Dallas rental listings specifically allowed cats and small dogs, while 20% allowed large dogs. Chicago, Denver, Phoenix, and Portland also make the top 10 in these three categories, and they show landlords favoring cats over dogs and small dogs to large dogs.



The “Hidden” Cost of Housing Your Pet
Finding a rental is just the first hurdle for pet owners. They may also have to fork out extra charges tacked on to the rent. These charges typically come in three forms: pet deposits, pet fees, and pet rents. What’s the difference? A pet deposit is a refundable fee paid upfront to the landlord on top of your regular rental deposit. A pet fee is similar, except it is not refundable. Pet rent is a monthly nonrefundable payment paid in addition to regular rent. The good news is that it’s very unlikely renters with pets would need to pay these fees. Less than 1% of the rental units listed on Trulia that allow pets specifically say they charge one or more of them. And, of all the rental units that impose pet fees, a whopping 78% charge only one. Just 22% charge two of these fees and less than 1% slam you with all three.

Washington, DC: The Capital of Pricey Pet Deposits, Fees, and Rents 
Washington, DC, is first in war, first in peace, and first in extracting money from pet owners with a litany of extra fees. In our nation’s capital, the average pet deposit is over $350, the average pet fee is over $425, and the average pet rent is nearly $45 per month—all three of which tops each fee category. Only three other metros make the top 10 most expensive lists in each of these categories, but they aren’t nearly as expensive as Washington. Dallas has relatively high pet deposits and fees of $288 and $275 respectively, but relatively low monthly pet rents of $9; Baltimore has pet deposits and fees of $261 and $235, but relatively expensive pet rents of $35 per month; Portland, OR, is even lower in average pet deposits and fees, $247 and $184 respectively, while pet rents there average $10 per month. Meanwhile, of the 25 largest rental markets, several average close to zero because few listings include pet fees. These metros include Cambridge, MA, Newark, NJ, Boston, MA, Philadelphia, PA, and Orange County, CA.



Does Muffy Need a Wash? Does Rover Want a Biscuit? Go West.
Like kids, our furry companions require lots of stuff. Finding a place to live that has abundant pet stores and services like vets, groomers, boarders, and dog walkers may be just as important as finding a pet-positive home.
Last year, Americans spent nearly $60 billion on pet supplies and services—everything from pet food to veterinary visits, grooming, and boarding. However, the concentration of these services varies significantly. To find the metros with the greatest density of pet-oriented businesses, we’ve tallied up every establishment tagged by Yelp in the pet category, including pet services, dog walkers, pet boarding, pet sitting, veterinarians, pet training, pet stores, pet groomers, and animal shelters.

Once again, the West is top dog. Nine of the top 10 metros with the highest concentrations of pet businesses are either in Washington State, Oregon, California, or Arizona. San Diego tops the list with one pet business for every 817 households. San Francisco, Seattle, Orange County, CA, and Portland, OR round out the top five. The only metro outside the West that makes the list is the college town where Harvard and MIT are located, Cambridge, MA, which ranks tenth.
To sum it up, Dallas, TX is the place to be if you want to find a rental that takes pets. You’ll get dinged with the most expensive pet charges in Washington, DC. If you’re looking to live somewhere with lots of businesses catering to your furry companion, San Diego is the place to go. Overall, San Francisco and the rest of the West are paw-some, offering plenty of pet-friendly rentals, low fees, and lots of opportunities to buy stuff for your four-legged friend."
ralph,Gone In 60 Days: Where Homes Are Moving Fastest This Spring,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/fastest-moving-markets-2015/,2015-04-15,"Homes are going especially quick in the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, Seattle, and Salt Lake City.; Housing inventory remains tight, and one of the questions on the minds of many homebuyers this Spring is just how fast they will have to move to get the home they want and can afford.
To find out how long homes are staying on the market, we calculated the share of homes for sale on Trulia over a two-month period. We first looked at homes listed on February 5, then counted how many were still for sale on April 5. Faster-moving markets had a lower percentage of homes still on the market after two months, while slower-moving markets had a higher percentage.

Our two-month measure is similar to a common housing statistic: days on market (DOM). In general, housing markets with more inventory and fewer buyers will have a higher share of for-sale homes remaining on the market after two months and a higher median DOM. But we prefer our two-month measure over the widely watched DOM as a way to determine how quickly homes are moving in a market. Why? We think DOM is potentially misleading. If lots of new inventory suddenly lands on the market, then the median DOM could fall thanks to all those newly listed homes. Thus, a low median DOM might indicate that buyers are snapping up homes quickly, so homes aren’t staying on the market long (a seller’s market). But it could also signal that a lot of new inventory has just come onto the market (a buyer’s market). As a result, it’s difficult to decipher what’s really going on based on DOM alone.
Looking for a Bargain Home? So Is Everyone Else.
Nationally, 60% of homes listed for sale on February 5 were still on the market on April 5, down a bit from 62% for the same period last year. What’s quickening the pace of sales? It turns out it’s homes priced at the low end of the market. To see this, we evenly divided all homes in each of the 100 largest U.S. metros into three price tiers. We gave each metro its own price cutoffs based on what’s considered high-end, mid-range, and low-end locally. On average, lower-priced homes moved fastest. Only 50% of homes in this tier were still on the market after two months compared with 65% of higher-priced homes.
What’s more, home sales in the low-price tier sped up more compared with a year ago than sales in other tiers. The share of low-price homes still on the market after two months dropped 3 percentage points, compared with a 1 point drop for middle-tier homes and a 1 point increase for high-tier homes. As always though, the national trend hides big differences from one local market to another. In many metros, the sales pace is quickening, while in others it is slowing.

California: Home to America’s Fastest-Moving Housing Markets
If you’re a home seller, California may indeed be the Golden State. Eight of the 10 fastest-moving housing markets are there, and homes are selling much faster than in the Northeast, South, and Midwest. In fact, fewer than 30% of homes for sale in the three San Francisco Bay Area metros remained on the market after two months. By contrast, about 70% of homes in Long Island and Albany, NY were still on the market. In addition, the only metros outside California that made the 10 fastest moving list were Seattle and Salt Lake City.

None of the fastest-moving markets have slowed since last year. In fact, the markets on our top 10 list that sped up the most are San Diego, Ventura County, and Salt Lake City. Other markets that are speeding up most rapidly are almost exclusively in the South and Southwest. The share of homes for sale in Cape Coral–Fort Myers, FL still on the market two months later dropped from 64% in April 2014 to 47% in April 2015. El Paso, TX and Richmond, VA also sped up at a similar pace, even though homes in those markets aren’t moving quickly enough to land them on the 10 fastest-moving markets list.
To illustrate this point, the figure below shows that homes in markets with bigger price increases tend to move faster, though not always. For the most part, these fast-moving metros are sellers’ markets where homes don’t sit very long.

Housing Markets Moving Sluggishly in Long Island and Albany, NY
In contrast, the slowest-moving markets are in the Northeast, including Long Island and Albany, and in the South, including Columbia, SC, and Knoxville. All but two of the 10 slowest-moving markets had year-over-year price increases below the 5% national average. However, even among these snail’s-pace markets, the share of homes still for sale after two months dropped in five of 10 metros. Knoxville and Long Island both all sped up 2 percentage points this year compared with last. It’s true that in six of the metros on this list, the pace of sales slowed in 2015 compared with the year before. The pace of sales slowed the most in Miami (9 points) and Pittsburgh (4 points)

Why do some markets speed up while others slow down? Last year we found the fastest moving markets were those that had the largest year-over-year price gains. Things don’t appear to have changed this year. In fact, asking prices increased near or above the national average of 5% year-over-year in six of the 10 fastest-moving markets.
But fast-moving markets are different in other ways, too. They tend to be more expensive to begin with. In other words, they have both higher price levels AND they’ve notched bigger price increases in the past year. Expensive markets—including many in California—have tight housing supplies because of limited construction in the face of growing demand. So homes get snapped up quickly. And this is bad news for first-time homebuyers. The combination of an expensive market and fast-selling homes at the low tier is yet another hurdle for first-timers, who are already getting slammed by declining affordability and slow wage growth. Now, even the homes they might be able to afford seem to be disappearing in the blink of an eye."
ralph,Why House Hunters Should Skip Sunday Brunch,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/open-houses/,2015-03-24,"Open houses overwhelmingly take place on Sundays and start most frequently at 1 p.m., but this isn’t always the case. Some open houses do happen between Mondays and Fridays, especially in the West. Likewise, Sunday open houses are much more likely to begin after 2 p.m. in some Southern housing markets, perhaps due to religion and local culture.; The home-buying season is upon us. With that comes millions of open houses across the country, where sellers show off their properties and would-be homebuyers take stock. So whether you’re a buyer, a seller, or just a nosey neighbor, here’s the story on when for-sale homes are likely to be open to the public. We’ve uncovered these insights by analyzing all listings on Trulia with scheduled open houses in 2014.
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday: The go-to day for open houses
If you’re planning on holding an open house, actively home shopping, or just want to stroll the neighborhood and poke your head in—no surprise—weekends are far and away the most common time for showing homes. But the breakdown is not even between the two weekend days. Open houses are over 2.5X more likely to take place on Sundays than on Saturdays, 67% versus 24%. So if you’re hunting for a home this weekend, looking on Sunday may give you the most choices.

Where You Can Hit Up Open Houses on Weekdays
But what if you can’t make weekend open houses? If you live in the West, you have a much better opportunity to attend an open house during the week. Over 11% of open houses in the West are held on weekdays. If you live in the Midwest, you’re out of luck. Only 5% of homes in the Midwest are held Monday through Friday. Weekday open houses in the Northeast and South make up about 8% and 9% of all open houses, respectively. The most common weekday for open houses is Friday except for the Northeast, where Thursday reigns.

Most Popular Time to Kick Off an Open House: Noon to 2 p.m.
While “location, location, location” is the mantra for real estate value, “time of day, time of day, time of day” may be the slogan for open houses. Among Saturday and Sunday open houses in 2014, 1 p.m. was the most common starting time, with a whopping 85% beginning at either noon, 1 p.m., or 2 p.m. But not all metros are alike. In the South and the Midwest, 95-99% of all 2014 open houses began between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m., a bigger percentage than in other regions. The West and Florida had the smallest percentages. But, even in those regions, between 45% and 68% of open houses began during the two-hour noon-to-2 p.m. window.

Where the “Church Effect” on Open Houses Is Very Real
A full 70.7% of Sunday open houses took place in the afternoon in 2014 compared with a bare majority of 51% of Saturday open houses. The greatest discrepancy was at 2p.m. Open houses held on Sundays were more than twice as likely to start at that hour as Saturday open houses.

This got us thinking: Are Sunday mornings and early afternoons reserved for churchgoing? At first glance, the answer was no. When it came to open house timing, we found that metros with the largest percentage of Christians were no different than other metros.
But things looked different when we examined the data more deeply. It turns out that Sunday open house scheduling did vary by metro in 2014 depending on which Christian denominations were most heavily represented. Those metros with the biggest concentrations of evangelical Christians were much more likely to have Sunday open houses that began after 2 p.m.  Why? It’s possible that evangelicals have longer church services, more active churchgoing members, or both. In metros with the largest proportion of evangelicals, sellers might hold Sunday open houses later in the day to avoid conflicting with church services.

But was this also a regional rather than just a religious effect? Metros with the largest percentages of evangelical Christians are largely in the South, a part of the country where midday Sunday dinners and family get-togethers might be more common. Indeed, we did find that Southern metros overall were more likely to have open houses that started at 2 p.m. or later, especially on Sunday.  But the evidence of a religious effect was strong. Among Southern metros, those with large evangelical concentrations were nearly three times as likely to hold open houses in the afternoon on Sunday as on Saturday.

The lesson here is that open house timing depends significantly on local culture. How people spend their time on weekends reflects faith, tradition, and custom. And those are things to which the real estate industry adapts.
Note: Our open house data consists of the date and start times of all scheduled open houses reported to Trulia in 2014. However, those data do not include ending times of open houses."
ralph,Dreaming Big: Americans Still Yearning for Larger Homes,"Millennials, Gen X and Baby Boomers",https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/americans-larger-homes/,2015-02-26,"43% of adults would prefer homes bigger than where they currently live, but attitudes differ by age. Baby boomers would prefer to upsize rather than downsize by only a small margin, while the gap among millennials is much wider, with GenXers falling in between. Would-be downsizers outnumber upsizers only among households living in the largest homes.; Last year, we found that Baby Boomers were especially unlikely to live in multi-unit housing. At the same time, we noted that the share of seniors living in multi-unit housing rather than single-family homes has been shrinking for decades. These findings got us thinking about how the generations vary in house-size preference. So we surveyed over 2000 people at the end of last year to figure out if boomers have different house-size preferences than their younger counterparts. And that led us to ask: What size homes do Americans really want?

Most Americans are not living in the size home they want
As a whole, Americans are living in a world of mismatch – only 40% of our respondents said they are living in the size home that’s ideal. Furthermore, over 43% answered that the size of their ideal residence is somewhat or much larger than their current digs. Only 16% told us that their ideal residence is smaller than their existing home. However, these overall figures mask what is going on within different generations.
It’s natural to think that baby boomers are the generation most likely to downsize.  After all, their nests are emptying and they may move when they retire.  As it turns out though, more boomers would prefer to live in a larger home than a smaller one: 21% said their ideal residence is smaller than their current home, while 26% wanted a larger home – a 5-percentage-point difference. Clearly, boomers don’t feel a massive yearn to downsize. On the contrary, just over half (53%) said they’re already living in their ideally sized home. Nonetheless, members of this generation are more likely to want to downsize than millennials and GenXers.
In fact, those younger generations want some elbow room. First, the millennials. They’re looking to move on up by a big margin: just over 60% told us their ideal residence is larger than where they live now – the largest proportion among the generations in our sample. By contrast, only a little over 13% of millennials said they’d rather have a smaller home than their existing one – which is also the smallest among the generations in our sample. The results are clear: millennials are much more likely to want to upsize than downsize.
The next generation up the ladder, the GenXers, are hitting their peak earning years and many in this group may be in a position to trade up. Many aren’t living in their ideally sized home. Just 38% said where they live now is dream sized. Nearly a majority (48%) said their dream home is larger, while only 14% of GenXers would rather have a smaller home.  This is the generation that bore the brunt of the foreclosure crisis. So, some of this mismatch could be because a significant number of GenXers lost homes during the housing bust and may now be living in smaller-than-desired quarters. But a much more probable reason is that many GenXers are in their peak child-rearing years. With kids bouncing off the walls, the place may be feeling a tad crowded.
Even the groups that seem ripe for downsizing don’t want smaller homes
Of course, age doesn’t tell the whole story about why people might want to downsize. It could be that certain kinds of households, – such as those without children, and living in the suburbs or in affordable areas – might be more likely to live in larger homes than they need. But our survey shows that households in these categories are about twice as likely to want a larger than a smaller home. For those with kids especially, the desire to upsize is strong: 39% preferred a larger home versus 18% who liked a smaller home.  For those living in the suburbs, the disparity is even greater – 42% to 16%. And even among those living in the most affordable zip codes, where ideally-sized homes might be within the budgets of households, 40% of our respondents preferred larger homes versus 20% who said smaller.

Are all households more likely to upsize than downsize?
At this point you might be asking, “Are there any types of households that want to downsize?” The answer is yes. But only one kind of household falls into this category – those living in homes larger than 3,200 square feet.  Of this group, 26% wanted to downsize versus 25% that wanted to upsize – a slight difference. But, when we looked overall at survey responses based on the size of current residence, households wanting a larger home kicked up as current home size went down. We can see this clearly when we divide households into six groups based on the size of the home they’re living in now. Among households living in 2,600-3,200 square foot homes, 37% prefer a larger home versus 16% a smaller home; in 2,000–2,600 square foot homes, its 34% to 18%; 38% to 18% in 1,400–2,000 square foot homes; 55% to 13% in 800–1,400 square foot homes; and 66% to 13% in homes less than 800 square feet. This makes intuitive sense.  Those living in the biggest homes are most likely to have gotten a home larger than their ideal size. And those in the smallest homes are probably the ones feeling most squeezed.

The responses to our survey show significantly more demand for larger homes than for smaller ones. But the reality, of course, is that households must make tradeoffs between things like accessibility, amenities, and affordability when choosing what size homes to get. The “ideal” sized home for most Americans may be larger than where they’re living now. But that spacious dream home may not practical.  As result, the mismatch between what Americans say they want and what best suits their circumstances may persist.
Survey Methodology
This survey was conducted online within the United States between November 6-10, 2014 among 2,008 adults (aged 18 and over) by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia via its Quick Query omnibus product. Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online.
All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, the words “margin of error” are avoided as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal.
Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in the online panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated."
ralph,Are We Past the Flipping Point?,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/flipping-point-jan2015/,2015-01-29,"House flipping activity tends to pick up as year-over-year price changes exceed 10 percent. Now that home prices have slowed in the recovery, even arms-length flips will become rarer.; Flipping is the practice of buying a house and reselling in a short period. Both professional and casual investors flip houses.  And like other asset trading, successful flipping involves buying at a discount, selling at a premium, or both—all of which is sensitive to changes in housing prices. We at Trulia Trends set out to explore at what point in the housing market price cycle flipping activity pick ups.
Selling houses at a premium generally requires price growth. The more prices are rising, the more profitable it is to flip. Thus, when prices are rising faster, flippers have greater opportunity to come out ahead. However, flipping activity can also accelerate when prices fall. That’s because foreclosures provide investors opportunities to get properties at discounted prices. To tease out how price increases affect flipping activity, we focus exclusively on nondistressed sales—transactions not involving foreclosures or short sales—of homes that had last sold within the previous 12 months.

A chart of home-price-change and flip percentages nationwide from the first quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2014 shows flipping sped up as prices rose and slowed as prices fell. In the first quarter of 2000, flippers turned over about 4% of all U.S arm’s length transactions, that is, transactions in which the buyer and seller are independent parties. By the third quarter of 2005, the percentage of flips had increased to nearly 7% of all arm’s length transactions. Between these two quarters, year-over-year increases in the FHFA national house price index went from just over 6% to almost 11%. Then, as prices plunged during the housing crash, the percentage of flips fell in 2011 to a low of 2% of all arm’s length transactions.
To better understand flipping, we grouped average flips at the metro level between 2000 and 2014 by level of year-over-year price changes. We found the flipping point—the point at which flipping activity picks up—to be around 10% year-over-year price growth. Metros that experienced year-over-year price declines had flipping rates between 1% and 2%. By contrast, metros that had 10% or more price growth on average had flipping activity between 4% and 7%.

But this is old news. What has happened with flipping lately? To get a current look, we plotted price changes and flip percentages for the 100 largest metros over the past year. We found a strong positive relationship. Metros with the highest flipping activity generally had above-average home price gains.

Six of the top 10 metros for flipping from the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2014 were in California. Nashville, Knoxville, Fort Lauderdale, and Cambridge-Newton-Framingham rounded out the list. Nearly all our top-ten flipper metros experienced above-median price gains in 2014 and most posted price growth near or above double digits. Still, we aren’t anywhere near the levels of frenzied flipping seen during the housing bubble, despite similar year-over-year price gains in many metros. All of the metros that registered year-over-year price growth above the critical 10% point had flipping activity around 3% to 4%. That’s on par with average flipping at that price growth range between 2000 and 2014—in other words, flipping is occurring at a historically normal rate. Moreover, we’re predicting slowing price growth in 2015 and flipping should moderate. You might say, we’re not expecting the housing market to flip out anytime soon!

Note on methodology: 
We differentiate between two different types of property flips: a “traditional flip,” which is the purchase of a house at market rate and selling it at a higher market rate price, because of improvement to the property and/or rising prices; and a “clearance flip,” which is the purchase of a distressed house at a discount because of a forced sale, such as a foreclosure, followed by a resale at market rate. We do not include clearance flips in our measure of flipping since our goal is to estimate the relationship between prices and flipping in a relatively normal, non-distressed housing market. As a result, our definition of a flip is a property that sold twice in a twelve-month period, in which both transactions are considered arm’s length."
ralph,Where Do Wild Turkeys Celebrate Thanksgiving?,Livability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/turkeys-celebrate-thanksgiving/,2014-11-21,"Ever wonder where turkeys lucky enough to survive Thanksgiving can be found? We set out to find the answer by looking at the annual USGS Breeding Bird Survey. If you’d like to find a turkey someplace other than the dinner table on Thanksgiving, the best place in the US, statistically speaking, is Roger Mills, OK. It averaged over 28 wild turkeys counted during the USGS 2.5-hour survey period. In fact, counties in Oklahoma and Kansas stuffed the top 10 list of the most turkey-populated places in the U.S.

We’ve also gathered the names and locations of self-styled turkey capitals in the US. Gobblers can be found hanging out in large numbers near these turkey-happy places, such as Turkey, TX; Barron, WI (turkey capital of Wisconsin); Fairview, MI (wild turkey Capital of Michigan); and, last but not least, Cuero, TX, which, perhaps immodestly, calls itself the turkey capital of the world. But turkeys are also giving thanks for their freedom this Thanksgiving in other parts of the country too. Areas of central Florida, northern California, and the Northeast also have dense populations of wild turkeys.

So, this Turkey Day, tip your hat to your dinner’s free-ranging cousin, our unofficial national fowl. Happy Thanksgiving from Trulia!
Methodology
To estimate the average number of turkeys found at the state and county level, we used the USGS Breeding Bird Survey route data from 2004-2013 to calculate an “average of averages,” whereby the state or county average is the average of all surveyed routes’ 10-year average of observed turkeys within that state or county. Note: Although the BBS consists of over 4,000 survey routes randomly distributed across the U.S., there is variation in the number of survey routes sampled in each state and county, both over space and time. As such, the actual abundance of turkeys at the county level may deviate from our estimates."
cherylyoung,"Rent Vs. Buy: Renting Rallies, but Buying is Still Best",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/rent-vs-buy-spring-2017/,2017-05-24,"Ever-rising prices for homes combined with flat or lower rents are changing the rent vs. buy equation in America’s biggest housing markets.
While it’s still a better deal to buy, the economic benefit has narrowed to the point that in some places, for some households, the decision to rent or buy a home may be too close to call. To calculate the financial cost of renting versus buying we assume that households stay in their home for seven years and can afford to put 20% down and a 30-year fixed rate mortgage when buying a home.
Under those conditions, the truth is that it is still cheaper to buy than rent in all of the 100 biggest U.S. metro areas, but that gap has dwindled recently as price growth outpaces rent growth. And in some markets small changes – a higher interest rate, less money down or a neighborhood’s characteristics – may make a rent vs. buy decision too close to call. Here are the key findings:
It is still cheaper to buy than rent across the biggest 100 metros, ranging from just over 50% cheaper to buy than rent in Baton Rouge, La. to a mere 3.5% cheaper in San Jose, Calif.
But, the financial advantage of buying versus renting has decreased in all of the 100 biggest metros from the same time last year due to the fact that mortgage rates have increased slightly, rent price growth has slowed or hasn’t changed in 93 metros, and home values have increased in all 100 metros.
It soon could be cheaper to rent in San Jose (if interest rates rise to 4.7%), San Francisco (5.1%), and Honolulu (5.3%).; Nationally, home prices have been tracking steadily higher over the past four years. While rents also increased from spring 2013 to spring 2016 before reversing course and declining 3.5% from spring 2016 to spring 2017. With rents and home values previously moving in tandem, shifts in the rent versus buy decision were largely driven by changes in mortgage interest rates.
Mortgage interest rates have fluctuated over the past four years, and the times when the rent versus buy margin change has not followed suit was when home price growth outpaced rent growth. In spring of 2014, mortgage rates climbed to 4.5%, but even though rates have fallen, the advantages of buying haven’t greatly improved. Why? Rents rose only 2.6% compared to homes prices rising 9.1%. Similarly, this spring sees a slight increase in mortgage interest rates but a significant decline in savings from buying than renting as rents decreased while home prices increased.; Q2 2013

Note: Among 100 largest U.S. metros. A negative percentage means homeownership is cheaper than renting. For example, it’s 3.5% cheaper to buy a home than to rent in San Jose.; The tipping point at which mortgage rates must rise to make buying an equal financial proposition to renting is closest in West Coast cities and New York. Seven of the 10 cities with the closest margins are located in California, with San Jose and San Francisco topping both this list as well as the list for most expensive metros. In fact, all 10 of these metros also hold spots in the top 20 most expensive metros.; Rents fell or were unchanged in nearly all markets from a year ago, except for seven. The markets with the largest rent increases included Albuquerque, N.M., (8.2%), Kansas City, Mo. (4.2%), Omaha, Neb. (3.8%), and Baton Rouge, La. (3.7%). Meanwhile, home values increased in all 100 metros. The cost of buying over renting dropped in all 100 metros. So despite the fact that the Federal Reserve Bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised rates twice since December, the impact on mortgage interest rates has been slight. Another potential policy change that may impact the financial advantage of buying is the Trump administration’s proposed tax policy. By raising the standard deduction, this policy would erode the financial advantage of buying. See Trulia’s recent report here. Moreover, if home values continue to outpace rent then the concern of homeownership being better financial decision hangs on how much home values increase for these metros.; The following outlines how Trulia calculates the costs of buying and renting:
We use our quality-adjusted measure of home prices and rents, which allows an apples-to-apples comparison between rental and owner-occupied housing units. We looked at median home value and rent in April 2017 in each of the largest 100 metros.
We calculate the initial total monthly costs of owning and renting, including mortgage payments, maintenance, insurance, and taxes.
We calculate the future total monthly costs of owning and renting, taking into account expected price and rent appreciation, as well as projected inflation.
We factor in one-time costs and proceeds, including closing costs, down payment, sale proceeds, and security deposits.
We calculate net present value, which reveals the opportunity cost of using money to buy a house instead of investing it. Net present value is the worth in today’s dollars of a future stream of payments and proceeds, taking into account expected interest rates.
Trulia’s Rent vs. Buy Calculator lets you compare renting and buying costs using other assumptions about prices, rents, and other factors. It uses the same math that powers our interactive map and this report. You can read our extended methodology here."
cherylyoung,"Led By Pacific Northwest, Case Shiller Hits Another High",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller-feb-17/,2017-04-25,"It’s a sellers’ market this home buying season as low inventory and strong demand increases competition.
Robust consumer fundamentals such as job and income growth continue to fuel housing demand despite hot prices.
Seattle, Portland, Ore. and Denver are the hottest markets, with Seattle posting its 13th straight period of double-digit price growth.
Today’s S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index was up again with a 5.8% increase over last year, making February’s index the highest in 32 months. Low inventory continues to underscore the narrative of housing market. Strong demand bolstered by income and job growth sets the stage for intense competition and continued price growth in the housing market. Consumers are likely to also take advantage of mortgage rates as they remain low. While the housing market looks to be recovering, these high prices impact the affordability of homes, directing the strongest headwinds towards starter-home buyers.; The 20-City Composite is also up from January, posting a 5.9% year-over-year increase. Cities in the Pacific Northwest remain hot with Seattle and Portland, Ore. leading year-over-year price increases. Seattle hit 12.2% increase, which was the 13th straight month of a double digit increase in home values. Dallas follows Seattle and Portland with an increase of 8.8% year-over-year."
cherylyoung,Demand Pushes Existing Home Sales to 10-Year High,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/existing-home-sales-march-17/,2017-04-21,"It's a sellers market across most of the U.S.; March’s existing home sales shoot up to a ten-year high as spring home buyers are undeterred by low inventory.
Promising economic conditions such as decreasing unemployment drove the strong existing home sales rate despite low inventory, demonstrating high demand in the face of rising prices and low supply.
The first quarter of 2017 shows strong start to home buying season. Existing home sales leapt 4.4% from March to an annualized seasonally adjusted rate of 5.71 million units, bucking February’s slide to reach a 10-year high. This bump up from the previous month accompanies another year-over-year increase of 5.9%.
Inventory also rose 5.8% over last month but remains flat and at near historic lows, with 16.2 units for sale per 1,000 households. Annual changes in inventory tell a more grim story since this represents a 6.6% decrease over this time last year.

While inventory remains, low the pace of existing home sales is relatively steady. The rate of existing home sales given inventory is 25%, inching back up to its pre-recession peak rate of 31%.

These promising numbers bode well for this rest of home buying season, showing that demand remains high despite the headwinds in the market."
cherylyoung,"Teacher, Teacher, Can You Live Here?",Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/affordable-housing/,2017-04-12,"In America’s biggest housing markets teachers, police officers, firefighters and restaurant workers struggle to afford homes in the communities they serve.; With home prices on the rise across the county and inventory at historic lows, homeownership is even more out of reach for many middle-income Americans. Nationally, the typical American worker makes $37,040 annually (national median income) while the typical American house costs $254,900 (national median list price). That means that the median worker would have to spend 42% of their income on mortgage payments if they bought a median-priced home, up six percentage points from two years ago.
However, medians don’t tell the whole story. To shed light on how unaffordable housing has become across the country today, Trulia examined the incomes of teachers, first responders, restaurant workers and doctors in nearly 100 major U.S. metros to see where people are struggling to afford to buy a home in the communities they serve.
Using the latest median wage data for each occupation[1] from the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently-released May 2016 Occupational Employment Statistics report, we calculated the share of homes for sale in each market that are affordable to each category of worker. We define affordability as having a debt-to-income ratio at 31%, which means one’s monthly payment on housing would only take up 31% of one’s paycheck. We assume that borrowers can put down a 20% down payment for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at a 4.1% interest rate. We also include any homeowners association fees on the property, property tax and insurance into the affordability calculation.
Our analysis found:
Restaurant workers faced the greatest challenges to affording a home. Receiving the lowest reported wages among the occupations examined, which hovered just above $20,000 a year, restaurant workers could afford less than 10% of the available homes in 56 of 93 major metros.
Seven of least affordable markets for teachers were in the coastal California metros such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. Austin, Texas, Denver, and Honolulu round out the top 10. Where a teacher’s salary goes furthest was in the Rust Belt where teachers could afford at least 75% of for-sale homes in Dayton, Ohio, Akron, Ohio, Detroit, El Paso, Texas, Syracuse, N.Y., Little Rock, Ark. and Toledo, Ohio.
Beyond the San Francisco Bay Area, first responders, such as police officers and firefighters struggle to find homes they can afford in high priced Southern California markets of Orange County, Calif. and San Diego. Less expensive markets where first responders are paid less, such as Raleigh, N.C., Madison, Wis. and Nashville also pose challenges to home buying.
Doctors,[2] the highest wage earners of any group examined here, find at least 50% of the housing in each market affordable in all but San Francisco where this percentage is just 41.57%. In Dayton, Ohio, Toledo, Ohio, El Paso, Texas, Columbia, S.C. and Little Rock, Ark., doctors get their pick of the lot as they can afford to buy 99% of listed homes.; ; At the other end of the spectrum, Dayton, Ohio appeared in the top 10 list of most affordable housing markets for each of the occupations analyzed. Restaurant workers can afford nearly a third of the homes for sale. Meanwhile, teachers, first responders and doctors could buy most of the homes on the market as 83.3%, 75.0% and 99.6% of homes are affordable to workers in these occupations, respectively.
However, housing markets with relatively low home prices may not always be the most affordable places to live if wages are also relatively low. Raleigh and Madison, Wis. have median listing prices in the low $300,000s, just above the national median listing price, but wages for first responders are some of the lowest for these metros. As a result, Raleigh and Madison are two of the least affordable markets for police officers and firefighters. Likewise, relatively high wages for an occupation may not be enough to afford the most expensive markets. First responders earn the most in San Francisco at just over $100,000 a year, but this is only enough to afford 2.6% of homes currently on the market.; In the middle of the affordability spectrum are markets like Chicago, where the median listing price for a home is slightly above the national median. Following the trend nationally, restaurant workers and doctors are able to afford the least and most homes in the market, respectively. However, teachers and first responders can afford nearly half of homes at 52.3% and 55.3% each.; ; San Francisco and San Jose, Calif. occupied two of the top three spots in terms of least affordable housing markets for each occupation we examined. This came as no surprise since both metros boasted the highest median listing prices in the country at $1.25 million and $917,903, respectively. Restaurant workers couldn’t afford any of the currently listed homes in these markets. Meanwhile, teachers and first responders could only afford less than 10% of homes. Doctors fared better, but could only afford 41.6% and 56.9% of homes, respectively.
While large shares of available homes remain unaffordable to teachers, first responders, and restaurant workers in some the nation’s biggest markets there are pockets of affordability in even the most expensive metros.  In the East Bay in the San Francisco Bay Area, or the Oakland metro area, 8.2% of homes are affordable to teachers. Many of these homes are located in Bay Area cities such as Antioch, Hayward and Union City. Meanwhile, first responders and doctors have even more options with 24.3% and 76.0% of the market affordable, respectively.; We started this analysis by looking at the share of affordable homes for one-income households for each occupations, but we know this doesn’t paint a complete picture of affordability. Many households have two-income earners, and thereby have more buying power.
When we calculated affordability for two-income households in the same occupation, we see that the pressure of finding an affordable home on the market is reduced—mostly. For first responders, doubling income ensures at least 50% of homes on the market are affordable to these households in all markets except in costly San Francisco. Two-income teacher households, however, still feel the crunch in San Francisco, San Jose, Calif., and Honolulu where less than 50% of available homes in these markets are within reach. Meanwhile, the number of markets where restaurant workers can afford less than 10% of listed homes drops to 12 from 56 by adding an additional income. However, two-income restaurant worker households still face acute affordability challenges in their home markets.
For this report, we only looked at the numbers for four occupations in major metros. Using this same affordability calculation, home shoppers anywhere can estimate how much home they can afford based on where they want to live with Trulia’s Affordability Calculator. Assumptions about incomes, down payments and other debts can be adjusted accordingly. It’s a great starting point for all serious buyers – at all income levels – who are starting their homes search.; Wage figures used in this report are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics for May 2016. Teachers here include elementary, middle and secondary school teachers and the median income is calculated by taking the average of these sub-categories. Restaurant workers include cooks, food preparation workers, bartenders, and waiters and waitresses. First responders include police and sheriff’s patrol officers and firefighters. Doctors here are family and general practitioners.
Affordability is defined as spending 31% or less of one’s monthly income on housing. In order to find the share of affordable homes on the market for the median income earner for each occupation we calculate the maximum amount that each person can allocate towards a mortgage payment based on their wage. Evaluating the listing price of each home effective April 2, 2017 minus a 20% down payment and calculating the monthly mortgage payment using the prevailing 30-year mortgage rate at that time of 4.1% in the markets we examine along with any HOA fees, mortgage insurance and property taxes we sum the number of listed properties that the median income earner for each occupation could afford.; [1] A number of occupations include multiple sub-categories and in these cases, the average of the median incomes were reported as the annual income. For example, teachers here include elementary, middle, and secondary school teachers (not including special education). Restaurant workers here include restaurant cooks, food preparation workers, bartenders and waiters and waitresses. First responders include police and sheriff’s patrol officers and firefighters.
[2] Annual median income that exceeds $208,000 is not reported. For doctors, there were 24 markets where doctors made at least $208,000 so we imputed that amount but can assume in some places doctors could make significantly more, impacting the share of homes they would be able to afford."
cherylyoung,America’s Fair Housing Legacy,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/fair-housing-legacy/,2017-04-05,"Has Homeownership Improved Since the Fair Housing Act of 1968?; Nearly 50 years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, racial and ethnic minorities still face few housing opportunities than all other households: they own homes at a lower rate, spend more of their income on rent and continue to contend with residential segregation.
The Great Recession disproportionately impacted black and Latino households as gains in these housing opportunities before 2000 were largely erased in the last 10 years. Locally, however, some metros bucked national trends to emerge as areas where housing prospects for black and Latino households improved.
Looking back at the changes in housing opportunities for the past few decades, we found:
Nationally, the homeownership gap between all households and black and Latino households has changed little since 1970.
The share of households that are rent burdened—spend 30% of their income or more on rent—increased after the housing crisis. More than 55% of black and Latino households are rent burdened compared to 47% of all households.
Homeownership increased the most for black households in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic from 1990 to 2015, increasing the most in Washington, D.C. (9.6 percentage points), Peabody, Mass. (9.3 points) and Fairfield County, Conn. (9.3 points).
Rust Belt cities like Troy, Mich. (-13.1 points), Grand Rapids, Mich. (-10.1 points) and Akron, Ohio (-9.4 points) topped the list of metros where homeownership decreased the most for black households.
Latino households saw double-digit increases in homeownership in Chicago (13.0 points), Hartford, Conn. (11.7 points) and Houston (11.7 points).
Residential black-white segregation decreased in 94 of the largest 100 metros from 1980 to 2015, improving the most in in the Florida metros of Fort Lauderdale, Sarasota and Cape Coral.
Texas metros of El Paso and San Antonio saw the largest decreases in white-Latino segregation.
In honor of Fair Housing Month and in recognition of the Fair Housing Act’s mission to protect home buyers and renters from discrimination, Trulia investigated how housing opportunities have shifted for underrepresented groups nationally and in the 100 largest U.S. metros. Using U.S. Census Bureau data, we examine three measures of housing opportunities: 1) homeownership rates; 2) residential segregation; 3) affordability (as measured by rent burden, or those who spend 30% or more of their household income on rent). We focused on how these opportunities have changed for African-Americans and Latinos, the two largest racial and ethnic minorities in the United States.; The national gap between the homeownership rate for all households and black households has remained nearly the same whereas the gap between all households and Latino households has narrowed slightly since the passage of the Fair Housing Act. This gap is even starker when comparing non-Latino white homeownership with black or Latino homeownership.
Since 1980, the gap between non-Latino white homeownership rates and black homeownership rates has widened from 24.1% to 30.63%, but the gap between non-Latino white households and Latino households has remained the same. The homeownership rate among Latino households overtook the homeownership rate among black households after 2000. Ownership rates across all groups have remained relatively flat. The housing crisis erased any gains in homeownership, with black homeownership facing the steepest decline from 2000 to 2010.; A few metro areas like Washington, D.C., Fairfield County, Conn., and Worcester, Mass. saw gains in homeownership for both black and Latino households. Otherwise, increases in Latino homeownership were driven by metros with large shares of Latino populations, such as Chicago and Texas metros.; Ten Metros where Homeownership Increased the Most from 1990 to 2015

6.7; Homeownership rates among black households suffered the most in Rust Belt metros in Michigan and Ohio as well as in markets that were hit hard by the housing crisis. California’s Central Valley metros of Bakersfield and Fresno were heavily impacted by foreclosures during the housing crisis and are still struggling to recover. The black homeownership decline in Bakersfield is more than three times that of the metro’s entire homeownership rate decline, indicating that black households were particularly susceptible to the economic downturn.; Ten Metros where Homeownership Decreased the Most from 1990 to 2015

-7.5; Those who are unable to buy have seen rent as a share of income increase as the cost of housing has outpaced income growth. The share of rent-burdened households, or those that spend 30% or more of their household income on rent reached nearly 50% of all renter housing in 2010. For black and Latino households, the share of those burdened by rent remains at more than 55% for both groups, while in 2015 the share of those rent burdened eased for the rental population at large.; High rent burdens are prevalent among the nation’s largest metros, but in some areas the problem is particularly acute. Across all renter households, the largest share of rent-burdened households in 2015 consisted of major metros in Florida and Southern California, including Miami (64.5%), Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (58.5%), Riverside, Calif. (58.2%), Los Angeles (58.2%) and Ventura County, Calif. (56.9%). Pittsburgh, with the lowest share of rent-burdened households, still has 43.5% of renters paying 30% or more of their income on rent.
Among black renters, Grand Rapids, Mich., (69.4%), Riverside, Calif., (67.1%), Rochester, N.Y. (66.9%), Fresno, Calif. (66.9%) and West Palm Beach, Fla. (66.0%) are the metros with the highest share of rent-burdened households. Peabody, Mass. has the second lowest rate of rent-burdened black households at 47.1%.  Among Latino renters, Miami (66.8%), Honolulu (64.1%), Ventura County, Calif. (63.5%), Fairfield County, Conn. (63.4%) and Orange County, Calif. (63.2%) have the highest share of rent-burdened households.
While the national picture appears grim in terms of housing opportunities for black and Latino households, some housing markets saw greater shares of homeownership, lower levels of segregation, and lower rent burdens for these groups.; Residential segregation between blacks and whites decreased in all but six of the 100 metros. Half of these metros were also those that saw the largest increase in black homeownership: Rockville, Md., Peabody, Mass. and Honolulu. The combination of higher rates of homeownership and increased segregation for blacks in these metros suggests that upper-income African-Americans may have formed enclaves in these metros. Increases in Latino-white segregation on the other hand is likely due to recent influxes of Latinos settling in communities across Tennessee and the mid-South.; Ten Metros where Segregation Increased the Most from 1980 to 2015

19.14; Metros with the largest decreases in white-black segregation are also those that started with some of the highest levels of segregation. Fort Lauderdale, Sarasota, Cape Coral and West Palm Beach had dissimilarity indices of over 80 in 1980. As a measure of segregation, a 100 on the dissimilarity index means a market is completely segregated, while 0 means there is none. So while there have been considerable reductions in segregation, the improvements come from a very high starting point.; Ten Metros where Segregation Decreased the Most from 1980 to 2015

-6.51; With nearly 40 years of the Fair Housing Act now in the books, some areas have improved housing opportunities for minority households, but there is considerable more work to be done. Identifying where progress has been made and where Americans continue to face impediments to securing safe and affordable housing is the first step to furthering housing opportunities for communities and ensuring they remain economically resilient.; The top 100 metros examined in this report are comprised of metropolitan statistical areas and metropolitan divisions definitions from 2000. Data for this report comes from the U.S. Census except for measures of segregation prior to 2015 which are from Brown University’s American Communities Project.
Throughout this report black households are households that identify as “black alone” and are not of Hispanic origin. Latino households are households that identify as Hispanic or Latino. The 1970 Census, however, did not ask a question about Hispanic origin but instead restricts the count to householders that report Spanish as their native language.
Homeownership is defined by the share of housing units that are owner-occupied. Figures for homeownership are from the Decennial Census or Historical Census of Housing Tables, except for 2015 which uses data from the 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS)
Rent burden is calculated by dividing the monthly gross rent by total household income (since household income is measured annually this is divided by 12). The share of those that are rent burdened are the total number of households that have a rent burden of 30% or more divided by all renter households. This share was reported in the 2000 Decennial Census, otherwise rent burden figures are calculated using Census microdata from IPUMS-USA, University of Minnesota.
Segregation is measured using the Index of Dissimilarity (DI), which is used to measure how evenly distributed distinct groups are across census tracts in a given metro. The DI reports the share of one group that would need to move to another census tract in order to achieve the same makeup of the larger metro, and can take on values from 0 to 100. For example, a DI of 55 for white-black segregation in a metro would mean that 55% of either group would need to move to another census tract for that metro to become fully integrated. This measure is appropriate when comparing non-continuous groups and is applied here when discussing rental and ownership housing as well as race. We rely on Brown University’s American Communities Project data and used their methodology to create segregation indices for 2015 using the 2015 5-Year ACS."
cherylyoung,"Case-Shiller Hits A New High, No Relief for Homebuyers",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/case-shiller-jan17/,2017-03-28,"Denver, Portland, Ore., and Seattle See Sharp Increases Again; There is little sign of relief from high home prices as we enter the spring home buying season. The tough buying market is characterized by competition driven by low inventory and challenges for first-time home buyers as prices outpace income growth.
Hot markets remain hot: Denver, Portland, Ore., and Seattle reached their highest index values ever.
Mortgage rates are lower than expected, so the anticipated cooling of home prices as a result of higher rates is likely delayed. Spring homebuyers will be eager to lock in rates that remain low.
Today’s S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index reached a two and half year high of 5.9% year-over-year in January, up from December’s 5.8% annual increase. January’s index kicks off the 2017 with the 10th consecutive period of positive seasonally-adjusted monthly gains. Low inventory continues to drive prices higher and indicates spring home buying season will be a challenge for first-time homebuyers. Mortgage rates are trending lower than expected despite the Fed rate hike earlier this month. This points to uncertainty in the financial markets, which will continue to color mortgage rate performance and keep home prices tracking higher.; The 20-City Composite is also up from December, hitting a 5.9% year-over-year increase. Denver, Portland, Ore., and Seattle remain hot—these cities reached their highest index values yet in January. While Portland is seeing the rates of year-on-year increases slowing from the previous month, Seattle posted a double-digit annual increase for the 12th straight month. San Francisco, which saw the index peak at an all-time high last month, saw prices dip slightly in January. Annual changes in San Francisco have slowed considerably from this time last year."
cherylyoung,"Home Sales Slow in February, Weighed Down By Low Inventory",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/home-sales-feb17/,2017-03-22,"Homebuyers are still plagued by low levels of resale homes on the market, and rising mortgage rates compound concerns for first-time and trade-up homebuyers gearing up for spring home buying season.
Strong consumer confidence in the housing market should keep existing home sales from sliding in the coming months, with homebuyers also seeing some relief in low inventory from the new construction end. But gridlock at the lower end of the housing market will keep existing home sales well below pre-recession levels.
After a strong start in January when existing home sales hit a near ten year high, February’s numbers bring a more moderate outlook as the spring home buying season kicks off. Low inventory continues to weigh on existing home sales, which slid back down -3.7% from January to an annualized seasonally adjusted rate of 5.48 million units. While existing home sales are down from the previous month, the year-over-year rise is encouraging, having posted their sixth straight gain since July of 5.4%.

Inventory rose 4.2% last month to 1.75 million units, but still lags previous levels, having posted a 6.4% year-on-year decline. Inventory has hovered between 15 and 20 units per 1,000 households for nearly five years, and February was no exception with just 16.1 existing homes for sale for every 1,000 households (seasonally adjusted).

Persistently low levels of inventory coupled with rising interest rates should concern homebuyers, however, high consumer confidence and peak home buying season may mitigate any large drops in existing home sales in the coming months."
cherylyoung,Housing Diversity,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/housing-diversity/,2017-03-09,"What Home Values Say About Inequality; America’s biggest housing markets are becoming more economically diverse neighborhood by neighborhood, a trend that’s not only an opportunity for potential buyers to break in but making those communities less homogenous.
But it’s not all necessarily good news. In most markets, the most affordable housing is disappearing.
Trulia studied home values as well as rental and owner-occupied[1] housing across the nation’s biggest metros. We found that during the last five years, expensive neighborhoods were still expensive when it came to affordability, but more moderately priced neighborhoods are on the rise.
And, as part of our analysis, we noticed there’s a strong relationship between the unevenness of housing values across metros and the racial and income segregation within a metro.
That said, not every metro is seeing a widening gap. Some places – Phoenix and San Diego, for instance – saw the economic divide shrink. That means homebuyers and renters can find a mix of luxury and entry-level housing across those cities’ neighborhoods.
Why is this important? Identifying the economic disparities could be useful to those in charge of housing policy when it comes to persistent economic and racial segregation. For instance, local government could incentivize low-income housing programs in neighborhoods where lower-priced homes are disappearing.
To gauge the unevenness of housing values in a market we created an index that measures the share of neighborhoods[2] that contain housing in the lowest and highest tiers compared to the median price of a home in that metro.
Ƒor example, in the maps of Detroit, below, neighborhoods are ranked based on how far its median home value deviates from the metro’s median home value. Our index measures segregation of home values on a 100-point scale and reflects the share of neighborhoods in the very high value (dark orange) and very low value (dark green) category. The closer the index is to 100, the more segregated the metro is by home values. In 2016, for example, Detroit’s home value segregation index was 72.2, meaning that Detroit saw a high level of home value segregation with 72.2% of all neighborhoods falling into the most extreme value categories.
[1] We define owner-occupied housing to also include for sale or sold but not occupied homes.
[2] Neighborhoods are proxies for census tracts in this analysis.; We found:
Nationally, House Hunters Have More Neighborhoods to Choose From:When it comes to home values across the 100 biggest metros, 1.62% of neighborhood housing[1] became less segregated in their respective regions from 2011 to 2016.
Fifty-five out of the 100 biggest metros have fewer neighborhoods categorized as very low value than five years ago, an indication that the majority of these markets are recovering from the housing crisis.
As Home Values Become More Polarized in a Market, Racial Segregation Increases: There is also a strong relationship between racial segregation in metros and housing values. Among the largest 100 metros, home-value segregation tends to increase as racial segregation increases. 
Metros with the largest segregation of home values in 2016 were Detroit (72.2), Milwaukee (66.7), Fairfield County, Conn., (61.0), Birmingham, Ala., (60.6) and Dayton, Ohio, (58.3). While NOT a causation or correlation, Milwaukee and Detroit were incidentally also two of the most segregated cities in terms of black and white residents.
Home Values Become Less Polarized Where the Sun Shines: In terms of changes in home value segregation Detroit, Charleston, S.C., and New York saw the largest increases from 2011 to 2016, while Phoenix, San Diego, and Cape Coral, Fla. saw the largest decreases.
More Housing Segregation between Owners and Renters in Smaller Markets: There is a strong relationship between how big a metro is and the imbalance of rentals and owner-occupied homes. More populated metro areas tend to have a greater mix of rentals and owner-occupied housing across neighborhoods, while smaller metros are more likely to be segregated in terms of rental and owner-occupied homes.
[1] Metrics for the 100 largest metros are calculated as an average across all of these metros, weighted by the number of occupied housing units.; Across the 100 largest metros, the segregation of home values decreased by 1.62 index points from 2011 to 2016 while the segregation between rental and ownership units fell by a scant 0.06 index points. Likewise, there was a similar movement when it came to racial segregation. Segregation between white and black residents increased by nearly three index points (2.99) from 2010 to 2015 while segregation between white and non-white residents[1] fell by 0.42 index points.
The 5-year shift in home value segregation shows how much neighborhood home values can change. Since 2010 the U.S. housing market has been in a state of recovery after being hit with mass foreclosures, driving many neighborhoods to lose considerable value. Almost no change in the imbalance of rental and owner-occupied housing, however, reflects the relative immutability of rental and ownership opportunities, which only change only when significant amounts of construction occurs or when residences are converted into rental properties.
More than half (53) of the 100 largest metros saw decreases in home value segregation from 2011 to 2016. Far fewer metros experienced decreases in segregation of household income, just 36 out of 100 metros. The largest increases in home value segregation were in the Midwest and on the East Coast, while six of the 10 metros that reported the largest decreases were in California. The question is, how do changes in home value segregation impact the lowest and highest value neighborhoods?
It turns out that the metros that saw the largest increases in home value segregation mostly saw the proportion of the inexpensive neighborhoods increase, except for New York, Allentown, Pa., and Boston. In other words, metros with the largest increases in home value segregation actually saw the gap between the most and least expensive homes grow at the bottom end of the market. In other words, the share of least-expensive neighborhoods grew.
[1] White and black residents include white and black alone, non-Hispanic. Non-white persons include people of all non-white races alone plus people of Hispanic origin, regardless of race.; Home Value Segregation Index 2011

7.02; On the other hand, metros with the largest decrease in home value segregation lost larger shares of least valuable neighborhoods than the most valuable neighborhoods. This suggests that metros with decreasing segregation, particularly in terms of fewer least valuable neighborhoods are rebounding from the housing crisis and experiencing a convergence of home values. During the housing crisis, concentrated foreclosures decimated home values in the lowest and lower- middle price tiers, but now that these units are back in the market, home values are recovering in the hardest hit neighborhoods.; Home Value Segregation Index 2011

-3.53; Measures of segregation of the housing market are related to racial and income segregation as well as the size of a metro’s population. The link between measures of home values and racial or income segregation are particularly revealing and may help to explain persistent residential segregation. Markets that are more segregated by housing values tend to also be more segregated in terms of household income and white-nonwhite residents. Meanwhile, there is a strong negative relationship between the segregation of rental and owner-occupied housing and a metro’s size by population. In other words, bigger metros tend to be less segregated by homes that are owned versus rented, and smaller metros more segregated.; These relationships suggest that efforts to decrease racial and income segregation, respectively, could be addressed by expanding choices in the housing market. The lack of housing diversity by price and ownership type constrain home seekers, particularly those that are lower income or those unable to purchase a home. As a result, they are relegated to finding homes where they are available, further entrenching both racial segregation and income segregation.; Segregation indices reported here are calculated using two methods. The first is the Index of Dissimilarity (DI), which is used to measure how evenly distributed distinct groups are across census tracts in a given metro. The DI reports the share of one group that would need to move to another census tract in order to achieve the same makeup of the larger metro, and can take on values from 0 to 100. For example, a DI of 55 for white-black segregation in a metro would mean that 55% of either group would need to move to another census tract for that metro to become fully integrated. This measure is appropriate when comparing non-continuous groups and is applied here when discussing rental and ownership housing as well as race. The general formula can be found here:
 

Where i is the ith census tract in a metro area, p is the share of group 1 or 2 in a census tract, P is the share of group 1 or 2 in the entire metro.
The second is the Index of Proportional Distribution (PI) used for continuous measures such as income or home values. This index counts of the number of census tracts that fall in one of six buckets based on the ratio of the median value of the metric in question at the census tract level to that of the larger metro. The PI is the share of census tracts that fall in the extreme bottom and top buckets, or categories 1) and 6) defined below. For example, if a metro has 100 census tracts and 40 census tracts have very low home values and 20 have very high homes relative to the median home values in the metro, the PI would be 40. The ratios that define the six categories used here are: 1) very low value – under 0.67; 2) low value – 0.67 to 0.8; 3) low-medium value – 0.8 to 1.0; 4) high-medium value – 1.0 to 1.25; 5) high value – 1.25 to 1.5; and 6) very high value – 1.5 and above.
Data on race, ownership type of housing units and income are from the U.S. Census’ 5-Year American Community Survey from 2010 and 2015. Figures from these surveys represent a rolling average over five-year periods ending in the year of release. The choice of using five-year data was driven by the fact that samples are large enough to cover census tracts. Note that because the ACS is a sample survey, they are subject to margins of error. Rental housing is defined by both occupied rental housing units as well as vacant housing that is on the rental market (e.g. rented but not occupied and or for-rent but not occupied). Ownership housing includes occupied owned housing units as well as vacant units that cannot be rented (e.g. sold but not occupied, for-sale but not occupied, and vacant homes used as second homes)."

• Inventory remains the cautionary counterpoint to otherwise positive existing home sales numbers, increasing only 2.4% over near record lows in December.
• Persistently tight inventory and expected increases in mortgage rates will likely temper existing home sales and continue to squeeze first-time homebuyers as we enter spring home-buying season.
January’s existing home sales brought a strong start to 2017, lifting the seasonally adjusted annualized rate to 5.69 million units, the highest in nearly 10 years. Strong consumer confidence and softening mortgage rates buoyed home sales to a 3.3% increase over last month. With 2016 ending in the best year for existing home sales in a decade, the current rate, scaled by population, is at 87.3% of pre-recession levels.; Low inventory remains the cautionary counterpoint to otherwise positive existing home sales numbers. January saw inventory of existing homes increase to 1.69 million units, a slight increase over December. Should mortgage rates creep up as anticipated, stronger headwinds are in store for homebuyers already facing thin existing supply.
 
Heading into this year’s spring home-buying season, the affordability and inventory challenges for first-time buyers are especially acute. Trulia’s Market Mismatch report found a shortfall of starter and trade-up homes when compared to search interest on Trulia for those homes. The premium home segment, however, had greater supply than demand with only 11 of the 100 largest cities having less inventory than search activity in the last quarter of 2016."

Regionally, the uptick in existing home sales varied: the Northeast led the pack with a 5.71% jump over 2015, while the West showed the least amount of growth in sales with just an 1.71% increase since last year.
After reaching a nine-year high in 2015, existing home sales were up again in 2016, making it the best year since 2006. December’s 2.8% increase over November puts existing homes sales at 83.8% of the pre-recession average, controlling for seasonality and household formation.

 
While these numbers inject some positive news into the housing market, inventory remains a persistent problem. December saw the second lowest inventory on record. Low inventory will moderate existing home sales as we enter 2017 and keep numbers below the pre-recession average as homebuyers contend with a limited number of homes on the market.

 
The coming year also brings with it a new presidential administration for the United States, which may impact existing home sales. Mortgage rates, are more than 50 basis points higher than they were before the November election. Already there are signs that policy changes may have an impact on the cost of mortgages under the new administration. On his first day in office, for example, President Trump suspended a proposed 25 basis point mortgage insurance rate cut for FHA-insured loans. This isn’t great news for home buyers looking to take advantage of the FHA insurance rate decrease to help offset the recent rise in mortgage rates."
cherylyoung,There Doesn’t Go the Neighborhood: Low-Income Housing Has No Impact on Nearby Home Values,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/low-income-housing/,2016-11-16,"In the nation’s 20 least affordable housing markets, low-income housing built during a 10-year span shows no effect on nearby home values.; Corrected Nov. 29 at 2 pm ET. See below.
Some of the nation’s least affordable markets are also ground zero for the fight against building affordable housing – which opponents say, among other things, depreciates nearby home values. Resistance to affordable housing development has surfaced in tight housing markets across the country such as San Francisco, New York, and Seattle.
Given low inventory and high prices in these tight markets, we set out to uncover how much homeowners really have to fear.
We define low-income housing projects as those funded through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Data on these low-income housing projects are collected by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Using Trulia home value data, we examined changes in nearby home values before and after a low-income housing project is completed. Based on the location of low-income housing projects and completion dates,[1] we determined whether or not these projects impact home values. We found:
In the nation’s 20 least affordable markets, our analysis of 3,083 low-income housing projects from 1996 to 2006 found no significant effect on home values located near a low-income housing project, with a few exceptions.
Among the cities where there was enough data to measure, San Jose, Calif., was the most aggressive in adding low-income housing units (7.81 per 1,000 people) during the decade. Meanwhile, Oakland, (0.52 per 1,000 residents) added the fewest units per capita.
Of the 20 markets examined, Denver was the only metro area where homes located near low-income housing projects registered a positive effect in terms of price per square foot after a project was completed.
In Boston and Cambridge, Mass., however, low-income housing projects had a negative effect on nearby homes in terms of price per square foot, suggesting a region-specific market effect for these two geographically adjacent metros.
We focused on the time period prior to the start of the housing bubble in 2007 in order to ensure that prices reflect consistent comparisons around the time a project is completed and ready for occupancy.
[1] HUD uses the term “placed into service” to denote when an eligible household can move in. For purposes of this report, we consider this the time at which the project is complete and ready for occupancy.; To test for spillover effects of low-income housing, we tracked home values in terms of price per square foot at two different distances from the low-income housing project from 1996 to 2006. For the neighborhood, we identified properties within an inner ring of 2,000 feet of a given low-income housing project as close enough to be impacted by the project. Properties located 2,001 to 4,000 feet from the low-income housing project were used as a comparison group.[1] The chart below illustrates how properties are placed into inner (light blue) and outer (green) rings around a low-income housing project (orange).
[1] Using distance measures as a way to compare potential effects of housing projects on property values proximate to a project site to those in surrounding neighborhoods is common in the academic literature. See Ellen et al. (2007)’s analysis of the effect of subsidized housing projects in New York City on property values by comparing price changes of properties within a 2,000 foot distance ring to those in similar surrounding neighborhoods. Ellen, Ingrid Gould, Amy Ellen Schwartz, Ioan Voicu and Michael H. Schill. 2007. “Does Federally Subsidized Rental Housing Depress Neighborhood Property Values?” Journal of Policy Analysis and Management. Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 257-280.; If there was an effect from the placement of a low-income housing project into a neighborhood, we would expect to see a drop in prices in the inner ring (red line) compared to the outer ring (blue line) after the project is completed (year 0). In terms of median price per square foot, the inner and outer distance buffers track closely together as shown in the figure below.; There is no statistically significant difference in price per square foot when comparing properties near a low-income housing project and those farther away when examining projects across all 20 metros. Likewise, at the metro level, the majority of markets yield no significant difference in prices between the inner and outer ring after a project is completed. However, a few housing markets revealed significant differences in price per square foot near low-income housing projects after they were placed into service.; Homes near low-income housing projects in both Boston and Cambridge saw a negative impact on per square foot property prices. Post-project prices near low-income housing projects saw an estimated $18 and $19 drop in prices per square foot relative to the outer ring. Given that these estimated effect in these two markets are geographically adjacent to one another, this effect might be attributed to a region-specific market effects that reflect where low-income housing projects were placed. Concentrating subsidized housing projects in particular areas such as Roxbury and Dorchester in Boston, or Cambridgeport in Cambridge in a short time period, for example, might have the effect of crowding out other development activity.[1] The chart below shows that in neighborhoods like Roxbury, prices were indeed depressed compared those of the greater Boston metro area.
[1] Indeed, the concentration of affordable housing development in certain areas seems to have exacerbated an unequal geography of where low-income residents have settled in the Boston area according to a recent report by the Boston Globe.; Unlike Boston and Cambridge, the effect of low-income housing projects in the Denver metro area were associated with a $7.35 per square foot increase in property values for the neighborhood versus the region. One possibility: parts of downtown Denver around where low-income housing projects were built saw a renaissance in the 1990s driven by the development of LoDo (Lower Downtown Denver) and the construction of Coors Field. Some of these neighborhoods in downtown Denver are now the most sought real estate in the metro area. Indeed, as the chart below illustrates, neighborhoods such as Central Business District and Five Points, where low-income housing projects were concentrated in our study period outperformed greater Denver in terms of home values per square foot.; Again, these are exceptions to the finding that low-income housing projects largely have no effect on home values. The bottom line for NIMBYs who fear that property values will take a hit when a low-income housing project locates nearby is that their anxiety is largely unfounded – at least in cities where housing is either expensive or in short supply.
This post has been corrected to reflect that it is the U.S. Treasury Department that administers the LIHTC program. An earlier version of this post said HUD administered the program.; LIHTC project location, unit count, and year placed into service data are accessed from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s LIHTC Database. While LIHTC projects do not cover the entire universe of affordable housing, they constitute the large majority of subsidized rental housing development in the nation. The precise location data of these projects also allows us to estimate their potential spillover effects on nearby property values.
Using the latitude and longitude of these projects, we constructed two distance buffers—one up to 2,000 feet from the project, and another from 2,001 to 4,000 feet. We then identified homes within these buffers and captured Trulia home value data for each of these homes from 1996 to 2006. Trulia home value data is collected as an annual snapshot on June 1st of each year. In order to avoid large shifts in prices from new construction, we only include homes with property records for the entire time period under study. The analysis in this report uses home value per square foot in order to control for changes for housing quality and mix as well as potential changes in value from renovations during the study period.
We use a basic differences-in-differences regression framework to estimate the difference in home values in the inner ring compared to the outer ring after the LIHTC project is placed into service. Differences-in-differences offers a way to identify the effect of a policy by examining relative changes in outcomes in treatment and control groups. In this report, the treatment group consists of those homes located in the inner ring, or nearby the LIHTC projects, and the control group are those in the outer ring. The assumption is that these homes, on average, only differ in terms of their relative proximity to the LIHTC project. Note that after plotting the median home value per square foot of the two distance rings before and after the project, we felt confident home values between distance rings prior to the time projects were placed into service shared common trends. The treatment occurs once the project is put into place, so the differences-in-differences reflects the difference between the treatment group and control group (a proxy for the counterfactual) in the post-treatment period compared to the pre-treatment period.
In order to control for idiosyncratic differences in home values within years and different metro areas, we include year fixed effects (and metro fixed effects for regressions containing projects across all 20 metros). Additionally, we implement cluster-robust standard errors on individual LIHTC projects in order to correct for likely correlation of errors terms within the clusters. Our results yielded differences that were statistically significant in three metro areas. In Boston and Cambridge, the estimated effect of living near LIHTC projects was -$18.05 and -$19.05 per square foot. In Boston the effect was significant at the 99% confidence level and in Cambridge at the 95% confidence level. In Denver the estimated effect was $7.35 and significant at the 95% confidence level.
Affordability is defined as the percent of a median household’s income in that market that would be needed to afford a mortgage payment on the median listing price of a home in that market. These median listing prices reflect Trulia listing data from Q3, 2016. Population figures in this report come from the 2000 Census."
cherylyoung,House Vote: 2016 Results,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/house-vote-results/,2016-11-09,"Here's our quick guide to selected housing ballot measures voters decided on Nov. 8. We will update with analysis and results throughout the day.; While much of the attention Wednesday is understandably focused on the surprising results in the presidential race, voters in housing-starved cities decided on multiple ballot measures seeking to determine the government and taxpayers’ role in providing ample, affordable housing.
In cities including Los Angeles, Portland, Orange County, Calif., and Asheville, N.C., voters mostly agreed to new taxes, bond issues or zoning changes that would require developers to add affordable housing units as part of any new plans. In notoriously pricey San Francisco, the vote was mixed with voters approving measures to aid the homeless and increasing affordable housing, but balking on a proposal to create a new housing commission as well as requiring a minimum number of competitive bids for affordable housing developments (we previewed many of these measures last week).
Rent control and stabilization measures results in California, however, were a mixed bag. The cities of Mountain View, Richmond and Alameda passed measures to keep rent increases in check, but similar measures in Burlingame and San Mateo were defeated. These results illustrate the division in the how the public perceives rent control measures and questions around its enforcement as a tool to keep housing affordable.
Overall, measures that sought to reduce the scarcity of affordable housing performed well. The importance of these housing issues in these markets is underscored by the fact that California voters had to wade through a hefty ballot consisting of 17 state propositions, and an additional 25 local measures in San Francisco.; Jurisdiction

cherylyoung,House Vote: Beyond the Presidential Race,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/election-nation-16-preview/,2016-11-03,"On Nov. 8, voters in some of the nation’s most expensive housing markets will have a say on how their communities respond to housing shortages, affordability and the homeless.; With the U.S. presidential election dominating the headlines, it is easy for voters to overlook the choices facing them Nov. 8 when it comes to housing in their communities.
In some of the nation’s housing-starved cities, a number of ballot measures – from proposed tax increases to construct public housing, to new rules for developers to offer low-income units – seek to address the pressing need for affordable housing and services for the homeless.
In this report we’ve identified some of the biggest ballot decisions facing voters. Next week we will review and analyze the results.
“While homebuyers and renters may be listening closely to the presidential candidates to find out how the election will impact their pursuit of home, they shouldn’t ignore measures in their own back yard,” said Trulia Chief Economist Ralph McLaughlin. “This is because voters will be deciding on a number of high-caliber and impactful questions at polls in a number of the least affordable cities across the U.S.”
“Voters should educate themselves on how local housing ballot measures will impact housing provision and, ultimately, who will bear the costs of that provision,” McLaughlin said.
McLaughlin added that housing ballot initiatives ultimately ask voters who should foot the bill for any policy: housing paid for by taxpayers, inclusionary zoning housing development paid for by developers, and rent control or rent stabilization paid for by landlords.
One exception is measures involving rezoning. Rezoning has comparatively little upfront cost and typically benefit both landowners, developers, and new residents though existing residents and developers may have to pay for infrastructure improvements such as roads, parks and schools.; We identified 22 local ballot measures[1] across 16 cities or counties that impact local housing markets and found that all of them touch on the core issues of affordable housing. Additionally, voters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, cities characterized by acute housing unaffordability and low inventory, face decisions on how to support housing and services for the homeless. Six other metros covered by housing measures are also included in the top 20 least affordable cities, including San Diego; Oakland, Orange County, Calif., San Jose, Calif., Portland, Ore., and Honolulu.
This November’s local housing ballot measures fall into generally four categories:
1) Taxpayer Funding for housing development through bonds or increases in sales tax;
2) Inclusionary zoning that requires developers to build affordable housing;
3) Rent control or rent stabilization efforts;
4) Amendments to the current planning codes, or zoning or land use ordinances. These tools vary in terms of both the ways in which the housing market is impacted as well as who bear the burden.
[1] This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all local housing ballot measures, but should reflect the variation in local markets and flavors of housing ballot measures.; Funding for affordable housing or homeless services in unaffordable markets are largely raised through debt securities such as housing bonds, or local taxes. Housing ballot measures during this general election reflect the reliance on bonds to fund affordable housing and homeless initiatives. The size of the bond varies greatly across jurisdictions, from $5 million in Orange County, Calif. to $1.2 billion in Los Angeles. Repayment on the debt service on all of these bonds are through increases in property taxes. In other words, the financial burden falls on homeowners in these jurisdictions with some of it passed on to renters.
Proposition C in San Francisco, however, intends to reallocate unused funds from a previous bond for an affordable housing loan program instead of raising new funds. Additionally, Proposition J (and K) in San Francisco proposes to fund homeless services through a quarter point increase in sales tax which would impact all residents. Sales taxes are viewed as regressive since lower income residents end up spending a greater share of their income on these taxes.

[1] Includes Oakland, CA metropolitan area.
[2] Includes San Jose, CA metropolitan area.; Inclusionary zoning is an affordable housing tool that stipulates a portion of new residential construction be made available below market rate. Income eligibility limits for these affordable units are set by the rules of the ordinance. Los Angeles intends to implement inclusionary zoning for the first time through Measure JJJ. In this case, the burden of inclusionary zoning falls on developers, who are likely to see a reduction in profit by charging below market rate for the affordable units. In San Francisco, on the other hand, Proposition U seeks to double the income eligibility limits from 55% of area median income to 110%. Here, developers are likely to be proponents of this measure since it will increase their profit margin over lower income limits at the cost of increasing the number those eligible for a finite number of units.

The California cities of Burlingame, San Mateo, Richmond, Alameda, and Mountain View have measures to put into place rent control or rent stabilization. Currently, annual rent increases are uncapped in these cities and these measures would limit increases to amounts pegged to the consumer price index as well as limit unwarranted evictions.; Voters will also consider a range of land use and zoning issues. Among them: freeing up open space for housing development in Sonoma County, adding incentives for affordable housing development in Encinitas, Calif. through the zoning code, or establishing a new Housing and Development Commission in San Francisco. Because these tools are managed by local entities, their implementation falls entirely on the responsibility of local entities to manage, enforce, and regulate these actions in these measures.

cherylyoung,Neighbor Pet Peeves,Livability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/neighbor-pet-peeves/,2016-09-28,"Americans seem to like their neighbors and get along with them, but from loud parties to ugly holiday decorations, they do have their pet peeves.; Can’t we all get along? Actually we do — mostly.
Despite a national discussion that suggests we’ve become a nation divided, the reality is when it comes to our neighborhoods we get along pretty well – even if we do bother one another from time to time.
We found that a majority of Americans are friendly with their neighbors and know them on a first name basis, but most people still admit to having pet peeves with their neighbors. Younger Americans, particularly millennials and Gen Xers, are the most sensitive and confrontational neighbors, suggesting that the “get off my lawn!” attitude associated with older baby boomers may be largely a myth.
It seems that everyone either has, or knows someone with, a horror story about their neighbors, evoking fears about nightmare neighbors. But how do Americans actually perceive their neighbors? What are the pet peeves about our neighbors that drive us nuts? Who makes a good neighbor and who doesn’t?
It turns out that most Americans get along with their neighbors. When asked to describe their relationship to their neighbors, 63% of Americans characterized their relationship as “friendly” and 10% considered their neighbors to be “very close” or even “best friends,” according to an online survey conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia. The survey was conducted from September 14-16, 2016 among 2,069 adults ages 18 and over. Additionally:
Over half (61%) of Americans who have neighbors know the first names of most of their immediate neighbors.
Given the relative harmony between neighbors, it is not surprising that only 1% of Americans described their relationship with their neighbors as hostile.
Millennials (ages 18-34) tend to either be very close or complete strangers with their neighbors. Sixteen percent of millennials consider themselves very close or best friends with their neighbors compared to 10% of Gen Xers (ages 35-54) and 6% of baby boomers (ages 55+), and 24% of millennials describe their relationship with neighbors as strangers compared to 12% of Gen Xers and just 6% of baby boomers.
Difficult neighbors are a source of concern for many, since nearly one in five (18%) Americans said that having a difficult neighbor would motivate them to move.
Despite generally positive sentiments towards neighbors, most Americans (68%) still griped about neighbor pet peeves and nearly half of Americans (49%) experienced a problem with a neighbor in the past 12 months. More than half (56%) of those who had issues with neighbors cited noise problems, for example loud music, pet noise, and loud parties. Visual or aesthetic issues, such as poor yard conditions, were a distant second (28%) in terms of neighbor related problems.; Noise-related

3. Overgrowth of trees/ plants
1. Trash
2. Cigarette smoke
3. Marijuana smoke; Among Americans who have experienced a problem with a neighbor in the past 12 months, more than half (56%) say they ignore it, but of those that do act, most (62%) choose to speak directly to their neighbor to resolve the issue, either in person or over the phone. More than one-third (35%) relied on third-party mediation and contacted authorities when facing an issue with neighbors. In a few instances, some people took more extreme measures by retaliating (10%) or actually moving away to escape a problem neighbor (6%).; Neighbor pet peeves and reactions to neighbor problems are not the same for all Americans. Age and generational differences appear to have a strong influence on what irks people and how they respond to problematic neighbors. Contrary to the popular stereotype of low-tolerance baby boomers, 63% of those 55 years of age or older reported having no problems with neighbors in the last 12 months. On the other hand, more than half of millennials (61%) and Gen Xers (52%) encountered issues with their neighbors in the last year.
Millennials were the most sensitive age group across all types of pet peeves when it comes to neighbors. Over 4 in 5 millennials (83%) claimed to have noise-related pet peeves compared to just two-thirds of the general adult population (67%). This is not surprising given that millennials are younger and tend not to own their home at this stage of their lives. Millennials, for example, comprise a much higher share of renters (52%) than Gen Xers (37%) and baby boomers (22%), which likely suggests they are living in closer quarters with others and may be more susceptible to neighborly annoyances. Indeed, Trulia research finds that millennials also tend to live in housing units that are likely to place them closer to more neighbors. Specifically, 27% of millennials live in either apartments or condominiums compared to 19% of Gen Xers and 16% of baby boomers. Renters as a whole are more likely to have experienced noise (37%) and odor (10%) issues compared to homeowners (22% and 5%, respectively) and seem to be less familiar with their neighbors as they are more than twice as likely to characterize their relationship with their neighbors as “strangers” (19%) compared to homeowners (9%).; Pet Peeve

46%; In addition to generational differences in pet peeves when it comes to neighbors, family structure and income appear to dictate how peeved people may be by their neighbors. Those with children in the household were almost two and a half times more likely to experience a space-related issue in the last year than those without, 14% versus 6%. Americans who make $100,000+ per year are more likely than those who make less than $50,000 per year to experience visual/aesthetic related issues with neighbors, 19% versus 11%, respectively. While fewer higher income earners seemed to have experienced issues with neighbors in the past year, more Americans earning more than $100,000 a year experienced visual or aesthetic issues than the general population, 19% versus 14%, respectively.; Millennials and Gen Xers reacted most strongly to problems with neighbors, while women and those who are retired tended to ignore problematic neighbors. Millennials and Gen Xers, however, handled their beef with neighbors in different ways. More Gen Xers who have experienced a problem with a neighbor in the past 12 months (29%) chose in-person dialogue to sort out issues with neighbors compared to millennials (19%). Millennials, on the other hand, relied on third-party mediation by contacting authorities at a rate twice that of baby boomers (20% versus 10%).
Overall, women who experienced a problem with a neighbor in the past 12 months tended to do nothing when encountering issues with neighbors, with 63% choosing to ignore problems with neighbors compared to 48% of men. Moreover, millennial women were the most passive group with 70% ignoring problems with neighbors compared to millennial men who had the lowest portion of ignorers at 33%. Retirees are also more laid back when it comes to those who have experienced a problem with a neighbor in the past 12 months compared to their employed counterparts, with 62% retirees choosing to ignore issues with neighbors compared to 51% of those that are employed. No retirees retaliate when they encounter problems with neighbors, but 7% of employed people take matters into their own hands.; Men

0%; Happy Holidays: just 6% of Americans consider holiday decorations left out well past the holidays a visual-related pet peeve when it comes to neighbors.
15% of Americans say that arguing is among their biggest noise-related pet peeves; renters are more than twice as likely to feel this way as homeowners (23% vs. 11%, respectively).
Just 7% of Americans inquire about neighbors before moving to a new home.
Half of those who have “space-related” pet peeves when it comes to neighbors (51%) said dog poop left in their yard or trash by a neighbor was a pet peeve.
Renters are twice as likely as homeowners to say noisy children are a noise-related pet peeve when it comes to neighbors (20% versus 10%, respectively).
A far greater share of those who are married (70%) consider their relationship to the neighbors as friendly as those who are not married (54%).
One in ten of those who are married (10%) characterize their relationship with their neighbors as strangers whereas more than one in six (17%) of those that are not married see their neighbors as strangers.
More than half (53%) of those who are married claim to be irritated by visual related issues, whereas 46% of unmarried people would be annoyed by neighbors’ aesthetic choices. Poor yard conditions (35%) and too many cars in the driveway (18%) were particularly irksome to married people.
Renters (32%) are more than twice as likely as homeowners (15%) to be peeved by the smell of trash when it comes to odor related issues with neighbors.
More educated people are bothered by social-related pet peeves; 58% of those with at least a college degree have social-related pet peeves when it comes to neighbors compared to 49% of those with a high school degree or less.
Those with at least a college degree are also more likely to have visual-related pet peeves when it comes to neighbors (55% versus 42% of those with high school degrees or less). Poor yard conditions are particularly bothersome to college grads. Thirty-five percent of them considered them a pet-peeve, while 24% of high school educated or less considered this an issue.
The reputation of welcoming and friendly Midwesterners appears largely true. About two-thirds of Midwesterners (68%) know their neighbors by first name, higher than any other region. The region with the second highest level of familiarity with neighbors is the Northeast, where 61% of people know neighbors by their first name, followed by Southerners (59%) and Westerners (57%).; This survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia from September 14-16, 2016 among 2,069 adults ages 18 and older.

fchacon,Cut-Rate Housing: Spring 2017,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/cut-rate-housing-spring-2017/,2017-05-18,"More landlords and sellers are cutting prices amid home-shopping season.; First, came the price cuts. Then rents cooled. As price cuts surge for for-sale homes, does it mean home prices are nearing a peak?
After five years of steep rent increases nationally, listing prices in the rental market are edging lower, and more often landlords are cutting advertised rents. Meanwhile, for-sale price increases remain strong, but sellers are still cutting prices to move homes off the market and doing so at an accelerating rate. This suggests that if price cuts are predictive, home prices soon could flatten. On the other hand, accelerating home prices could just be making it more difficult for sellers to price their home right from the get go.
Looking at the share of listings that go through at least one price-cut in both the rental and for-sale markets, here’s what we found:
In the rental market:
Nearly one in 10 rental listings had a rent cut: The share of rent cuts for rental listings nationally increased 1.2 percentage points from May 2016 through April 2017 to 9.7% from 8.6% the prior year (May 2015 to April 2016).
The pace of rent cuts is slowing: Just looking at listings from February through April 2017 (8.2%) and comparing that with the same 3-month period in 2016 (7.7%), the increase of 0.5 percentage points is not quite as dramatic as when looking at annual data, which could indicate that price-cut growth is stabilizing.
A majority of big rental markets saw cuts increase: Eighty-three of the top 100 metro areas saw the share of rental listings that had a price cut increase from last year to this year.
In the for-sale market:
More than one in 10 for-sale listings had a price cut: The share of for-sale listings with price cuts nationally increased 0.5 percentage points to 10.9% from 10.4% during the year ending April 2017 from 10.4%. This compares with a 0.5 percentage-point increase six months ago.
Price cuts rose sharply for for-sale homes: Annually, the share of for-sale listings steadily risen, but looking at the same data for the three months ending April 2017 compared with the same period last year, there is a 1 percentage point increase from 9.8% to 10.8%, indicating a quickening movement toward more price cuts.
Most major housing markets saw cuts increase: Sixty-nine of the 100 largest metros saw the share of for-sale listings with a price reduction increase from last year to this year.; Until March, the year-over-year monthly change in rent reductions in the rental market had been consistently pointing toward more and more cuts. Only recently has there been a break in that trend as rents are finally edging lower after five years of sharp increases in the post-recession expansion. The national median listed rent, at $1,650 a month, is now 2.9% lower compared with last year as opposed to six months ago when prices were still on the rise. The plateauing of rent growth and gradual return of price cuts in the rental market, are signs that rent cuts themselves may be leveling out could be pointing to the return of a more stable national rental market rather than one in which price appreciation was a given and landlords had little incentive to cut their initial listing price.; Growth of price cuts in the for-sale market has remained more volatile than in the rental market, but recently pointed strongly toward more price cuts even as the national median listing price, at $259,900, increased by 6.1% year-over-year in April 2017. As with rentals six months ago, this could be an indication that price growth may moderate in the coming months.; Taking a closer look at metro-level data, Texas markets again dominated the list when it comes to the increase in the percentage of listings with rent reductions for rentals. Texas metros led our list in November. This time, Dallas led with a +6.5 percentage point change, followed by Austin (+4.8 percentage points), Houston at No. 3 (+4.2 percentage point), and Fort Worth at No. 13 with (+3.0 percentage point).
For the past couple of years, Dallas, Austin, and Houston have all permitted new multifamily units, which are often rentals, at rates well above their historical averages. While high demand has been keeping pace in these areas, this may be changing for some of these markets. Bay Area markets, San Francisco (+1.1 percentage points), No.44 and San Jose, Calif., (+1.0 percentage point), No. 48, and Denver, Col. (+2.3 percentage point), No. 24, have fallen from Nos. 3, 6, and 7, respectively, from six months ago, though they still remain the places with the highest share of listings that see a price reduction.; % of Rental Listings with Largest Y-o-Y Increase in Rent Reduction

Download data for the 100 biggest metros here.; Dallas again takes the No. 1 spot for the metro with the largest increase in proportion of for-sale listings with price reductions, followed by San Antonio, Texas, at No. 2. These places both saw a 3.0 percentage point increases. Price growth in Dallas (and San Antonio until recently) has been increasing at well above the national rate. This makes it a bit more difficult for sellers to accurately price their homes. Additionally, Texas is the largest nondisclosure state in the country. Having less information about how much other homes are selling for makes it more difficult to price your own home. San Francisco fell to No. 5 from No. 1 six months ago with a 2.8 percentage point increase in price reductions on for-sale properties over the last year, but the proportion of price reductions remains low overall with only 8.6%, which is the third lowest out of the top 100 metros. Last year, only 5.8% of listings in San Francisco saw a price reduction, which was the lowest out of the largest 100 metros.
The places that have the highest overall share of rental listings that experience a price cut skew heavily toward Bay Area metros such as San Jose, Calif. (21.2%), San Francisco (21.3%) and Oakland (15.2%), which are all in the top 10. On the other end are places like Boston, Fresno, Calif., and Long Island, N.Y., which all had fewer than 5% of rental listings go through at least one price cut and all saw fewer price cuts this year than last.
On the for-sale side, sellers in Camden, N.J., (18.8%), Chicago, (18.4%), and Phoenix (17.6%) saw the highest share of listings go through at least one price cut in the past year. In Madison, Wis. (7.6%), Honolulu (8.3%), and San Francisco (8.6%), the fewest sellers seem to be budging from their initial asking price.; % of For-Sale Listings with Largest Year-over-Year Increase in Price Reduction

The report uses the entire price history of every listing found on Trulia’s website, for both rental and for-sale, dating back to May 1st of 2015 and up until April 30th of 2017. We calculated the total number of unique properties in each month and, the number of unique properties each month that saw at least one price reduction. This enabled us to calculate the percentage of listings that saw a price reduction.

fchacon,Grandpa Was a Millennial,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/grandpa-was-a-millennial/,2017-04-26,"While millennials are consistently needled for struggling to adult as well as previous generations, a closer look suggests that some of these narratives are overblown.; We’ve all heard that millennials, members of what some have called the “boomerang” or “basement” generation, are more likely to live with their parents or grandparents, less likely to be employed, and struggling with a low-paying job than Gen X, boomers or the silent generation when they were the same age.
Well, millennials may have 99 problems, but they’re not alone.
We examined young adults ages 28 through 32 – those old enough to be out of school, but still fairly fresh in the labor market — and compared them with older adults in their prime working-age, 33 through 55, at various times throughout the last 55 years. When it came to homeownership, employment, and income, millennials as a group are worse off in raw absolute numbers. But in comparing how young adults fare versus older adults, the gap in success has remained the same throughout time. This indicates that many myths about millennials are unfounded. When members of any generation become young adults, they struggle in the same way young adults struggle today.
Where millennials do diverge, the differences seem to come from trends that started long before millennials began reaching adulthood. Here are some highlights of our findings:
Millennials just as likely to live with their parents as Gen Xers: As of 2016, 14.5% of millennials ages 28 through 32 lived with their parents or grandparents compared with 5.5% of those 33 through 55. That is, older millennials were 2.7 times more likely to live at home than older people still under age 55. In 1999 Gen Xers as young adults were 2.2 times as likely to live with mom and dad.
Young adult baby boomers were more likely to live with their parents: By comparison, the last time this rate was as high as 2.7 was in 1982 when those in the middle of the baby boom generation were 28 through 32 year olds. They were 2.8 times more likely to live at home with their parents or grandparents than 33 through 55 year olds. The low of the past 55 years occurred in 1964, when 28 through 32 year olds (the silent generation) were only 1.8 times more likely to live at home than their older peers.
No matter the era, recessions hit young adults hardest: In bad economic times, young adults tends to lose jobs and live at home at higher rates.
In what ways are millennials actually struggling? 28-32 year olds in 2016 who didn’t live with their folks, owned at just 61.9% the rate of their older peers, or a little more than half the rate. This is the lowest rate of homeownership since 1975 Young adults are increasingly putting off home buying as many have delayed marriage and having kids.
Philly is where Millennials are #winning at adulting: As of 2015, millennials are more likely to own homes, make more money and have jobs than their older peers in places like Philadelphia, Grand Rapids, Mich., Omaha, Neb., and New Orleans. Where they are being left in the dust is in Lake-Kenosha Counties, Ill.-Wis., Newark, N.J., Silver Spring, Md., and Bridgeport, Conn.; While it is true that millennials who were 28-32 in 2016 were more likely to live at home with their parents or grandparents than the same age-group in any prior year going back to 1962, the same thing can be said for people ages 33-55 in 2016. So if the proportion of people living at home with their parents is going up uniformly for all age groups, should we really be surprised that the youngest among working-aged adults are still standing out with the highest rate?
During the decade from 1982 through 1991, boomers between the ages of 28 and 32 were, on average, 2.6 times more likely to live with parents and grandparents than their older peers ages 33-55. During the most recent decade from 2007 through 2016, 28 to 32 year-olds (millennials and the younger Gen Xers) were also 2.6 times more likely to live with their folks than those 33-55. This suggest that while we are at new highs in the overall rate at which people are living with their parents, it represents an overall shift in all working-age generations in response to the recent recession. Home buying has become more difficult for young adults since the 1970s. This trend was interrupted only by the buying spree leading up to the most recent recession.; Similarly, when considering unemployment rates, today’s young adults are no worse-off compared with their older counterparts now than they have been for the past 50 years. There is a surprising level of regularity in the comparative likelihood of being unemployed at various times between older and younger working-age people. Since 1962, the 28-32 cohort who are unemployed but looking for work has oscillated at a level 30% higher than that of their older peers.
Not only do 28-32 year-olds live at home at rates comparable to older folks today as in the past, they were also only 29.5% more likely to be unemployed than those 33-55 in 2016. That compares with 41.7% to 51.7% more likely in the late 70s and early 80s and in 1990, periods which cover both older and younger members of the baby boom generation, respectively.; The same cannot be said of trends in the homeownership rate though. Of those millennials between 28 and 32 that did live away from mom and dad in 2016, only 39.1% of them lived a home they owned compared with 63.2% (or 0.6 times the rate) of people ages 33 to 55. This represents the largest homeownership gap between the two cohorts since the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey began asking the question in 1976.; Additionally, the earnings of younger individuals have slid relative to their older counterparts consistently throughout the course of the last five decades. During the decade from 1962 through 1971, the 28-32 year-old cohort, who would all classify as members of the Silent Generation, earned 91.1 cents for every dollar earned by the older cohort of working-age people. During the most recent decade of younger Gen Xers and older millennials in the 25-32 cohort, that gap has increased to 75.3 cents per dollar.
In 2016, the most recent year of data available, 28 to 32 year-old employed millennials in 2016 earned 78.2 cents for every dollar earned by employed 33-55 year olds. This is an improvement from the all-time low of 72.6 cents in 2015, but a far cry from the peak of 92.4 cents earned by 28-32 year-olds for every dollar earned by 33 to 55 year olds in 1963 (silent generation).; For a more localized look at where 28 to 32 year-old millennials are doing the best compared with their older working-age peers, we ranked the largest 100 metros to see where millennials were killing it on homeownership, education, employment and income.
Millennials who were 28 to 32 during 2015 and living in Philadelphia were 43.0% more likely to have a college degree than their older peers. This may help explain why they earned 78.8 cents for every dollar earned by those 33 to 55, which is a higher amount than in any of the other largest metros.; San Francisco and Cape Coral, Fla., are the only two metros that have lower unemployment rates for 28 to 32 year olds than for 33 to 55 year olds. In San Francisco though, the younger cohort is only 46.9% as likely to own their home as the older cohort, which is the largest gap of any metro area.
Some of the place where the younger generation seems to be fairing the worst relative to their older peers include Silver Spring, Md., Oakland, Calif., Lake and Kenosha counties, Newark, North Port, Fla., and Long Island, N.Y.. In Silver Spring, older millennials were 3.7 times more likely to live at home than their older peers. Additionally, of the ones that were employed, they only made 60.3 cents for every dollar earned by the older cohort.; The big takeaway from all this study is that it is important to distinguish between what young people typically do and what older or younger adults seem to be doing at unusual rates. Many of narratives surround the current state of millennials are being made outside the context of what every young adult does at unusually high or low rates and regardless of where the long-term trends have been pointing for decades.; To compare young adults ages 28 through 32 with older adults at various times throughout the last 55 years the Census’ Current Population Survey (CPS) microdata was used. Only people or households headed by people between the ages of 28 and 55 were used for all data points mentioned in the report. Birth years were estimated by subtracting age from survey year. Relationship to household head was used to identify adults that were either living with their parents or grandparents. Generations were assigned as follow:
Birth Year > 1925 & <= 1944 – Silent
Birth Year > 1944 & <= 1964 – Baby Boomer
Birth Year > 1964 & <= 1981 – Gen X
Birth Year > 1981 & <= 1998 – Millennial
Birth Year > 1998 & <= 2016 – Gen Z
For the localized information and ranking 2015 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) microdata was used with the same age filters as described above. Puma-level microdata was assigned to specific metro areas and weighted using conversion files from the University of Missouri’s Data Center.

fchacon,Mismatched Markets: America Is Looking For Starter Homes in a Premium Home Market,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/market-mismatch-q12017/,2017-02-08,"Search interest in starter homes in Texas, Florida and North Carolina far exceeds inventory.; Note: an earlier version of this report gave the incorrect percentage of searches for starter homes. The number has been corrected.
 
Nationally, the average market mismatch score across the starter, trade-up, and premium price tiers rose 1.8 percentage points to 7.4 percentage points during the fourth quarter 2016 – with most shoppers searching for starter and trade-up homes but most listings being premium homes.
The widening gap between listings and searches underscores the difficulty home buyers face in locating an  affordable home they like. More than half of Americans who had been in the market to buy a home during the past two years (58.5%) said the process was either somewhat or very competitive. This compares with 37.8% of those who were exclusively in the market for a rental during the same time period, according to a recently commissioned survey conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia.
Market mismatch[1] is our measure of search interest versus available listings. In other words, it’s the difference between the price point where the bulk of searches occur and the average price point of listed properties. For instance, if 60% of buyers are searching for starter homes but only 40% of listings are starter homes, our market mismatch score for starter homes would be 20.
For our second installment of Mismatched Markets, we dove deeper into who and where people are feeling squeezed the most given how tight inventory is throughout the country especially for starter and trade-up homes. So this time we are classifying listings and searches into our starter, trade-up, and premium price categories and looking at them side-by-side to see which markets have the largest mismatches. Here is what we found:
Lack of starter and trade-up homes is indicating unbalanced markets. We found a 5.7 and 5.3 percentage-point shortfall of listings relative to search interest in the starter and trade-up price categories and an 11 percentage-point surplus of listings relative to search interest in the premium price category, averaging out to 7.4 percentage points. This is what we call our “market mismatch score.”
Searchers and sellers are drifting apart when it comes to price. This compares with a market mismatch score of 6 and 5.6 during the 4th quarters of 2014 and 2015, respectively.
Starter and trade-up homes are most sought after. 26.9% of all searches were for starter homes while only 21.2% of listings were at that price level.
The gap between searches and listings is similar in the trade-up category with 30% of all searches chasing only 24.3% of listings.
Premium buyers have it easiest. This leaves potential buyers in the premium category with the best chances of experiencing a less competitive home buying process with only 43.5% of searches viewing 54.5% of all listings.
Starter home hunters in Raleigh, N.C., and Colorado Springs, Colo., are feeling the most pinched with 14.0 and 13.1 percentage point gaps between search volume and listing availability.
Philadelphia on the other hand has a surplus of starter listings relative to search volume with an 11.6 percentage point gap between them and a 13.2 percentage point shortfall in premium listings compared with searches to that price-tier.
During the most recent quarter, of the largest 100 metros, 75 had a larger percentage of search interest in the starter homes category than percentage of listings that were actually starter homes. 92 metros had a listing shortfall relative to search interest in the trade-up category. Meanwhile, only 11 of the largest 100 metros saw a larger percentage of search interest fall in the premium category compared with the percentage of listings in that same tier. This disparity, with increasing numbers of metros experiencing a shortage of starter and trade-up listings and fewer metros with enough interest to match the proportion of premium homes, is the largest it has been in at least two years. It leaves Americans who are in the market for a home increasingly chasing too fewer options in lower price ranges, and sellers of premium homes more likely to be left waiting longer for a buyer.

11; Places with the largest average search-to-listing gaps across the three price tiers all have more search interest in starter and trade-up homes and a surplus of listings in the premium category. There are four Texas metros in the top-10 most mismatched markets along with three metros from the Carolinas and two from Florida. Dallas has the highest average mismatch at 17.5 percentage points. Searches in the starter category here make up 18.1% of traffic but are chasing only 6.2% of listings. Similarly, 32% of searches are for trade-up homes, while only 17.6% of listings are the same. This leaves the remaining 49.9% of searches going to premium homes which make up a full 76.2% of listings.
During the past two years Dallas, like every other metro on this list with the exception of Houston, has seen inventories decline at a faster rate than the national average, contributing to higher market mismatch. In Houston, while inventories have actually grown during the past two years, there was also a sharp decline in job growth as a result of low oil and gas prices, likely pushing some shoppers to take a more conservative approach to their home shopping.; Top 10 Mismatched Markets

12.2; Looking at the premium price tier, the places with the biggest shortfalls in these listings relative to search traffic all tend to be in low cost metros with the exception of Los Angeles. Additionally, slower population growth or population declines, and the low quality of available housing stock is a common theme among most of these places. Philadelphia and Detroit are the only two metros that have a surplus of listings relative to searches in the starter and trade-up categories, and deficits in the premium category. The average mismatch score across the three price tiers for each metro in this group is smaller than the national average though and some of them are actually among the 10 markets with the least market mismatch. This is partially because the premium surplus and starter and trade-up shortfalls in most markets are so high, that the few places that actually have the opposite mismatch are much closer to balanced overall.; Top 10 Metros with Largest Premium Listing Shortfall Q4 2016

-11.0; So while inventories are declining throughout much of the country, there are big differences in how these inventory declines are likely being experienced by people who are actually in the market to buy a home in local markets. Low and declining starter and trade-up inventories in places like Detroit or Philadelphia seem to be causing less of squeeze at the low end because most searchers are looking for premium homes anyway. In Houston, on the other hand, there is significantly more search interest in starter and trade-up homes that is being met only with a lot of premium options.; Note: The calculation for the market mismatch was adjusted from the first installment of this report. This means the numbers between this installment and the previous one are not directly comparable. However, all the data presented for 2016, 2015 and 2014 in this report was pulled using the updated method.
Additionally, while the same price cut-offs are used to define starter, trade-up, and premium homes nationally and in the 100 largest U.S. metros as in the quarterly Trulia Price and Inventory Watch , the weights assigned to listings differs, resulting in some differences in the inventory make-up. This different weighting was necessary to ensure that we are only counting site traffic to properties when they are actively on the market.
The Market Mismatch Score was based on all the for-sale listings (excluding pending and active contingent) on Trulia, which were pulled on quarterly basis beginning in Q4 2014. The distribution of prices for each metro and nationally was calculated by taking each active listing and adding up the number of days it was on the market during the quarter. All unique price points were consolidated and counted by summing these day & price combinations. In other words, if 10 properties were on the market for a combined 600 days at a price of $200,000, then the $200,000 price point would receive a weight of 600.
Site traffic from Trulia was matched to each unique property (and therefore price) on the market during the same time periods and added up for each quarter and price tier.
Listings and searches were assigned starter, trade-up, and premium price categories based on the price. “Market Mismatch” scores were then calculated by taking the difference between the percentage of listings in each of the three price tiers and the percentage of site traffic that went to each price tier. The average deviation from 0 for each category, regardless of the sign of the difference (+/-).
This survey referenced was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia from February 1-3, 2017 among 2,175 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. For complete survey methodology, including weighting variables, please contact dweidner@trulia.com."
fchacon,"Sale Fail: Signed, Sealed and Then, No Deal",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/sale-fail/,2017-01-11,"Deals to sell homes are falling through at a faster rate than than they were a year ago and it’s agreements for starter homes that are most at risk.
There is at least one thing that both parties in a home transaction usually want: for the sale to go through as quickly and easily as possible. If a loan can’t be secured or an inspection comes back with red flags, then a painless transfer could prove elusive. We wanted to see where it was most common for properties to go from agreement to sell, or what’s called an “active contingent” or “pending” status back to “for sale” or “for sale by owner”. We call these “sale fails.” Here are some key takeaways from what we found:
Nationally, sales have been failing at an increasing rate, rising to 4.3% in Q4 2016 from 1.4% of all listed properties during Q4 2014. On an annual basis, the failure rate has nearly doubled to 3.9% in 2016, up from 2.1% in 2015.
New homes and very old homes are least likely to see deals fail. As of Q4 2016, homes built in 2016 have among the lowest proportion of failed sales at 2.6%. That proportion increases steadily as age increases to an average of 5.2% in homes built from 1959 through 1969, then falls steadily to an average of 3.5% for homes built from 1900 through 1920.
Of all listings in the largest 100 metros, 7.1% of starter home listings failed in the most recent quarter, compared with 6.7% of trade-up homes and 3.8% of premium homes. For all of 2016, the failure rate was 6.3% for both starter and trade-up homes and 3.6% for premium homes.
During the last two years, the places with the most failed sales are predominantly in the West with Las Vegas leading the pack at 7.6% of all unique listings reverting back to “for sale” at least once.
During the most recent quarter, Tucson, Ariz., saw the highest rate of failed deals with 13.9% of all unique listings retrogressing. For all of 2016, Ventura County, Calif., had the highest fail rate at 11.6%, up from 3.1% in 2015.
Considering both the last two years and just the most recent quarter, Madison, Wis., has had the fewest listings fall back to a “for sale” status at 0.1% of all listings.
Since the fourth quarter of 2014, the share of listings that fail at least once has increased by 2.9 percentage points to 4.3% from 1.4%, with most of this increase occurring after the fourth quarter of 2015. Annually, this rate increased from 2.1% in 2015 to 3.9% in 2016. Among possible reasons for this, we suspect that an increasing number of first-time homebuyers are getting back on the dance floor, along with people whose credit was hurt during the recession.; First-time homebuyers have made up 35% of sales in 2016 up from 32% in 2015, and this is just among successful transactions, according to the National Association of Realtors. Not only are first-time hombuyers unfamiliar with the process, they face unique hurdles. They don’t bring equity or a credit history from a previous home. Their finances face additional scrutiny. And for those seeking an FHA loan for down payment, there are restrictions on type of home and its amenities.
One indication that first-time homebuyers are at least partially the source of increasing sale fails is the increasing dominance of starter and trade-up home sales that are falling through. Starter home sale fails have increased from 2.4% in Q4 2014 to 7.1% in Q4 2016. Trade-up and premium homes have increased from 2.4% and 1.5% to 6.7% and 3.8%, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2016, of the 100 largest metros, 62 of them had the highest proportion of failed sales occurring in the lower 1/3rd of homes by value, or what we call starter homes. 36 of the remaining metros had the highest proportion of failed sales occur in the middle third of all homes by value (trade-up homes) and only 2 had the highest proportion of failed sales occur in the upper third (premium homes). In comparison, in Q4 2014 only 50 metros had the highest proportion of failed sales occur in the starter home price range while 39 and 11 metros had the highest proportion in trade-up and premium homes, respectively.; America’s Top 10 Metros Where Starter Home Sales Failed in 2016

NOTE: Among 100 largest U.S. metros. To download the full data set, click here.; Home age also seems to be a pretty good predictor of a sale fail. As of the fourth quarter of 2016, homes that were built in 2016, had among the lowest failed sale rates at 2.6%. In the national chart below, you can see that as homes age, the fail rate increases steadily, with homes that are around 50 years old having the highest failed sale rates (i.e. homes built in early 1960s), then declining, in a less uniform manner, as the year built approaches 1900. One reason: premium home listings make up more than 70% of all listings that were built after 2000 and less than 40% of homes built before 1980. Since premium homes have the lowest fail rate regardless of year built, their dominance drives down the fail rate in more recently built homes, and their smaller role pushes up the fail rate in older homes.; However, in all three price categories, starter, trade-up, and premium, the same pattern emerges with the newest homes having the lowest fail rate, followed by a sharp rise, then a gradual decline. Homes that are 20, 30 or 40 years old are more likely to be running to their first round of expensive necessary upkeep and improvements, which would increase their chance of having potential buyers shy away. Beyond these formative years though, in order for a home to still be livable, some minimum level of upkeep needs to have been put into it. Major structural problems and other things that deter potential buyers have likely already been taken care of. Additionally, buyers looking at older homes are probably less surprised to hear bad (expensive) news from an inspection than buyers of newer homes. In the chart below, we have taken listings from our largest 100 metros and divided them into their lower, middle and upper third price tiers based on local home values in each metro, and then broken them out by the year they were built and fail rate.; Of the top 10 metros that have had the highest proportion of failed sales during the past 2 years, eight of them are in the West and three of those are in California. The two that are not in the West are Atlanta and Chicago with a quarterly average of 7.2% and 6.5%, respectively, of all unique listings reverting back to a for sale status. In comparison, looking only at the most recent quarter, seven of the top 10 metros are in the West, but four of those are in California. Charleston, S.C., has moved up to second among the top 100 metros from 88th with 11.9% of sales failing, up from 1% in Q4 2014 to second. See the full table here. {link to full table with quarterly fail rates by metro}
What does all this mean for you? As a potential buyer, make sure you’ve done everything you can in the way of mortgage approval/preapproval and know your financial limits. This will make it easier to recognize potential challenges and opportunities earlier in the search and transaction process. As a seller (or agent), it will serve you well to know your market and the home. Don’t be afraid to be forthcoming with problem areas that would likely come up in an inspection.; The daily status of all listings were pulled for the first two months of each quarter from Q4 2014 through Q4 2016. Any properties that went from “Pending”, or “Active Contingent” back to “For Sale”, or “For Sale by Owner” were tagged as a property that reverted in status. From there, the proportions of listings that reverted in any given geography or price range or by any aspect of the homes (such as year built) could be determined.
When looking at how failed sales are distributed across price ranges, we define the price cutoffs of each segment based on home value estimates at the metro level of the entire housing stock, not listing price. For example, we estimate the value of each single-family home and condo and divide these estimates into three groups: the lower third we classify as starter homes, the middle third as trade-up homes, and the upper third as premium homes. We classify a listing as a starter home on the market if its listing price falls below the price cutoff between starter and trade-up homes."
fchacon,Covert Costs: Utilities Are the Hidden Cost of Housing,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/covert-costs-utilities/,2016-10-26,"It’s not about the weather. Utility bills can represent nearly half of a household’s monthly housing costs – and no, it’s not in the places you’re thinking.; Depending on where you live, utility bills can have a huge impact on housing affordability – something that’s especially true in less expensive areas where what looks like a bargain on paper may not really end up being a bargain.
Trulia partnered with UtilityScore to find out how much of the monthly budget utility bills cost households in single family homes. With winter around the corner, if you are moving to a new place or into a single family home for the first time, either as a first time home buyer or renter, you could be in for a costly surprise.
Before we get into the findings, keep in mind that we use utility costs as a percentage of home value. We use that number to help us measure monthly housing costs for both renters and owners. There are other variables too; insurance, taxes and mortgage interest among them. Where noted we’ve used estimates of those costs in our overall monthly costs.
Here are a few highlights from what we found:
Nationally, based on data from UtilityScore, people in single family homes spend a median of $2,715 annually ($226 monthly) on utilities, or $1.68 on a square foot basis, or 1.4% of the median single-family home value.
Utilities are the hidden cost when buying or renting a single-family home in Georgia. The median annual utility cost for the state are the highest in the country in dollars at $4,347, as a proportion of single-family home values at 2.9%, and the second highest on a per square foot basis at $2.48 (after Hawaii at $2.57).
Of the largest 100 metro areas, Atlanta has the most expensive median annual utilities by dollar amount at $4,353, and is in the top 10 on both a price per square foot basis ($2.31) and as a percent of home values (2.6%).
El Paso, Texas has the least expensive median annual utility cost at $1,818, and the 6th most inexpensive on a price per square foot basis at $1.28.
Of the top 20 most expensive zip codes by median annual utilities, all of them are in Arizona and coastal California metro areas with the exception of one in downtown Elizabeth, N.J., in the Newark metro area (07201) and the Sea Island area near Brunswick, Ga. (31561).
Climate is not a good predictor for how much median utilities are at the zip-code or metro level.; Our analysis suggests is that if you are buying or renting a single family starter home, depending on where you live, utilities could have a big impact on overall affordability; in some cases even between zip codes that border each other.
Owners and renters in single family homes who reside in places with lower home values such as Detroit and Pittsburgh can be paying just as much for utilities on average as they do for their mortgage or rent payments. For residents in the most expensive metros like San Francisco or Honolulu on the other hand, utilities are just as high in dollar amounts, but look trivial after getting past monthly housing costs.
On the western outskirts of Tucson, Ariz., in the Avra Valley and Three Points areas (zip codes 85653 and 85735), homes are similarly valued, in the $180,000 range, and are of similar size. Buying home with a 30-year mortgage and 20% down payment would cost roughly $1,000 per month after taxes and insurance in either of these places, and rental prices would be similar. A home in Three Points though will cost more than 2.5 times in utilities compared with a home in Avra Valley, or a monthly average of $620 per month compared with $240 per month. This would have a huge impact on a home’s overall affordability. Similar disparities can be found along the border of Idaho and Oregon near Boise, along the Georgia-Florida border and the Georgia-Tennessee border, and in the more vacationed parts of south-west Orlando around Disney World and Kissimmee.
In most places though, looking at utility expenses as a proportion of home values reveals a more predictable pattern. Most metro areas, where home prices tend to be higher than their surrounding rural areas, look much less expensive comparatively. Coastal regions, both metropolitan and otherwise also look much more affordable when considering home values. The entire state of Georgia, save a few of the pricier zip codes in the Atlanta area, still shows up as expensive for utilities.; We were surprised to find that there is no significant correlation between climate and median annual utility amounts. If we assume 72 degrees (Farenheit) is a comfortable temp for most people and take the difference in average temp from 72 at various times of the year in each metro, the places with the largest deviations from comfortable do not have higher annual utility bills than places with very little deviations from comfortable temps.
Taking another look at the top 20 most expensive zip codes by dollar amount, most of these places have unusually large homes in them; eight with a median home size of greater than 3,500 square feet. But Dillon Beach, Calif. (94929) in the San Rafael, Calif., metro and 85736 in the Tucson metro have more modest sized homes (1,565 and 1,644 square feet, respectively) yet run a median of $10,369 and $8,071 for utilities annually. This also puts both of these zips among the most expensive on a price per square foot basis. Why? As UtilityScore points out, Dillon Beach is part of the San Rafael metro area, they are serviced by a small municipal water utility that charges high rates. UtilityScore notes that single family homes in the Three Points area (near Tucson) on the other hand, sit on lots with a median size of over an acre. Doing anything with the landscaping of these homes, other than leaving them the way they are, requires large amounts of water in an area that already has high rates.; We simplified our look by combining water, gas, or electric rates into a single price per square foot measure to determine who is actually paying higher rates across the country. At the state level, Hawaii comes in on the top of this list at a median annual cost of $2.57 per square foot. Looking at utility costs as a function of square footage tends to make places with larger homes look cheaper than places with smaller homes. This is why it is even more surprising that Massachusetts and Georgia, which are both among the top 10 largest states by median home square footage, are also in the top 10 most expensive states for utilities by square foot.; UtilityScore data was provided to Trulia at the household level for all single family homes that were available in the UtilityScore database as of July 2016. With this data alone, median annual utility bills as well as the median annual utilities on a price per square foot basis were mapped at the zip code level. Internal home-value estimates were also assigned to each zip code for which we had UtilityScore data to calculate median utility amounts as a proportion of home values at the zip code level. All three of these metrics were also calculated at the metro- and state-level.
Average climate data for January, April, July, and October from NOAA was used to check how weather impacted utility bill amounts at the metro level. Average temperature deviations from 72° for each month were summed across the 4 months used to come up with an aggregate “deviation from comfort” score for each metro area. This deviation from comfort was tested against median utility bills as a possible source of bill variation, but the correlation was underwhelming."
fchacon,Mismatched Markets: You Can’t Always Get What You Want,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/marketmatch-q416/,2016-10-06,"What direction is your market looking?; U.S. homebuyers are finding fewer properties that fit their budget, and in some markets, the majority of available homes may be too expensive given the current demand, a new analysis by Trulia suggests.
Today, we’re launching a new, semi-regular report called MarketMatch that gauges the price points home seekers are searching and compares them to the prices of available properties.
In our inaugural look, we found that nationally 10.4% of searches at a certain price point failed to match the available inventory at that price point. And in many markets – including many in Florida, North Carolina and Texas – many home seekers are disproportionately looking at homes priced much lower than available inventory.
When it comes to shopping for a home, buyers are at the mercy of the market. But, what they’re searching for is more a function of budget and tastes. If you are a prospective home buyer looking in the same price range as a bunch of other prospective buyers, but there are very few homes available in your market in that price range, you will have a frustrating time. On the flip side, if you are selling a home and have priced in a price range that very few people are interested in, you may be waiting for a while.
These sorts of mismatches in the market can drive up prices in certain popular price ranges or cause properties to sit on the market longer than they otherwise would. As discussed in Trulia’s quarterly inventory report, many metros are tight on starter homes at the moment and heavy on higher-end homes. This puts upward pressure on starter home prices, especially in metros where people seem most interested in lower price ranges.
As peak home buying season wraps up across much of the country, we look at how well individual markets match up with search interest. We categorized metros into three groups:
Places where there’s a disproportionate amount of searches for homes are in lower price ranges relative to what is available;
Places that are right on the money, where listing prices and search interest match up well;
And places with rich tastes (or lousy housing stock) where people are disproportionately searching for homes at higher price points relative to what is available.
Looking at all active listings and the number of times those listings were viewed nationally and in the 100 largest U.S. metros from March 15 to Sept. 15 we found:
Nationally, the mismatch rate is 10.4% between the distribution of home prices that users are viewing and the distribution of prices of all listings, what we call “market mismatch.” This compares with a market mismatch rate of 8.3% during the same 6-month period in 2015.
53.4% of all properties viewed nationally were priced below the median list price compared with 51.0% during the same period in 2015.
Houston and Dallas have the highest and second highest market mismatch scores of 31.2% and 30.3%, respectively. As market mismatch approaches 0%, you would expect the share of searches that go to homes below the median to approach 50% (half the homes would receive half the search activity). A full three-quarters of all search activity occurred on houses that were priced below the median listing price in both these metros though.
Buyers in only 10 of the 100 metros looked at more expensive homes than were mostly available. These are places where users are showing disproportionate interest in higher priced homes. This list includes Detroit, Philadelphia, and Dayton, Ohio, where only 39.7%, 42.2%, and 44.8% of searches are for homes that are less than the median listing price.
Honolulu, New Orleans, and Albuquerque, N.M., have the lowest market mismatch scores of 6.2%, 6.9%, and 7.0%, respectively.
Miami saw the largest increase in market mismatch going from 8.6% in 2015 to 21.2% during the same period in 2016. Colorado Springs, Colo., on the other hand saw the largest decrease market mismatch going from 28.6% in 2015 to 16.1% in 2016.; First, let’s take a closer look at the places with the highest proportion of searches being done in the lower half of all listings during that time. While Houston leads this group with the highest market mismatch score of 31.2%, this is actually a slight improvement from 2015 when the market mismatch was 32.1%. With a median listings price of $334,950 during the 6-months ending Sept. 15, 75.5% of all properties viewed in Houston were homes below this price. Of the six Texas metros in the analysis, five of them are in the bottom quarter of market match scores in 2016 (El Paso being the exception). Also making this list are Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C., and North Port, Fla., all with more than 69% of search interest being directed toward the bottom half of listings by price, all with market mismatch scores over 23% and higher than their respective 2015 scores.; Metro Area

4.1%; Pinning down exactly why a market would have mismatched search interest relative to available listings comes down to local market dynamics. In the case of Houston (and much of Texas), year-over-year job growth has gone from 3.6% in early 2015 to 0.6% today, partially as a result of oil prices tumbling more than 50% in the latter half of 2014. With job growth now well below the national average of 1.9% and prospects more limited, shoppers are likely taking a more conservative approach to their home search. In Dallas, however, job growth accelerated from early 2015 to today, yet the mismatch is large and growing when compared with the same period in 2015. Unlike Houston which was fairly flat, the median listing price and price per square foot in Dallas climbed 11.8% and 10.4% year over year in August 2016, while search interest remained relatively unchanged, further driving a wedge between interest and listings.; Metro Area

3.5%; If you are a house hunter or seller in any of our top 10 Market Match metros, odds are you found your experience less frustrating than someone in a mismatched market. In New Orleans, for example, where the market mismatch was 6.9%, almost exactly half of all properties viewed were below the median listing of $236,000. Buyers looking for homes in the popular $150,000 and $250,000 range find this to be the most popular price range for people listings their homes. Baton Rouge also makes this list coming in at number 10 with a market mismatch score of 8.6%. There is a much clearer lower price preference in overall search interest in Baton Rouge, La., though with 59.8% of all search activity being done below the median listing price of $219,900 during this time.; Finally, there are the handful of places where search interest disproportionately falls on the high-end of the listing price spectrum. The market mismatch scores for these places are relatively low, in the mid-10% to high single-digit range, but these markets are unique in that Trulia users are disproportionately showing interest in listings at price points above the median listing price recorded during peak home buying season. In addition to Detroit, Philadelphia, and Dayton mentioned above, Camden, N.J., Toledo, Ohio, and Gary, Ind., also make this list. In addition to being among the most inexpensive markets among the top 100 metros, population decline as a result of net out-migration, and the low quality of available housing stock is a common theme among all of these places.; Metro Area

2.0%; There are many factors that could be contributing to mismatched search trends relative to available listings including local economic factors and demographic trends, to just changing Trulia user demographics. As a longer history of search interest relative to listings becomes available going forward, how individual areas change over time and in response market forces will shed more light on how search and inventory patterns relate to pricing. During our next installment of this report, we will look more closely how these listing and search patterns fall into the starter, trade-up, and premium price ranges in each metro and what effects this may be having on shoppers and sellers in these tiers.
 
To download our full MarketMatch data set for the top 100 U.S. metros, click here.; All listings that were for sale (excluding pending and active contingent) between the dates of 3/15/2016 and 9/15/2016 were used for 2016 and 3/15/2015 and 9/15/2015 were used for 2015. The distribution of prices for each metro and nationally was calculated by taking each active listing and adding up the number of days it was on the market during this 6-month period. All unique price points were consolidated and counted by summing these day & price combinations. So if 10 properties were on the market for a combined 600 days at a price of $200,000, then the $200,000 price point would receive a weight of 600.
Site traffic was also matched to each unique property (and therefore price) on the market at this time and added up for the 6-month period.
Kernel densities were estimated for both listings and search interest using the weights described above. “Market Mismatch” scores were then calculated by measuring how much overlap exists between the two distributions in any given geography. So there is a distribution of listings by price and a distribution of search activity by price, each of which have an cumulative area of 1.0 or 100%. When calculating the area of overlap between the two distributions, if they were to line up perfectly, the market match would be 100% (the mismatch would be 0%). Any deviation from perfect match results in a score of less than 100%. This provides an overall measure of fit for a geography, but in order to determine the degree of price preference in searches relative to listings, we needed to also examine which way deviations from 100% match were skewed. Weighted median listing prices (weighted by the days available multiplied by the number of properties described available at that price, as described above) were then compared to web traffic weighted by the number of times each price point was viewed to come up with the proportion of views below the market median listing price."
fchacon,Family Tradition: Kids Are More Likely to Own a Home If Their Parents Did,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/family-tradition/,2016-08-10,"Homeownership is strongly influenced by family. Children of parents who owned a home are nearly three-times as likely to own when they’re adults. This predictor suggests young millennials may have the fewest percentage of homeowners in the last 50 years.; The recent revelation that homeownership among American households at a 51-year low, has ignited a national discussion about the value of homeownership. It’s also having a fallout in the public policy arena: what’s causing the erosion of the “American Dream” is back as an issue in presidential politics.
One part of the puzzle: the effect of family influences on home buying. We examined more than four decades of data from the University of Michigan’s Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and found that in at least one way, kids actually do listen to their parents. Children raised on homes their parents owned, rather than rented, were nearly three-times as likely to buy a home themselves.
It’s also a trend that persists as those kids get older and make more money – there is an 79% chance someone who is 40, has a household income of $100,000 annually and grew up in a family-owned home themselves became homeowners, compared to a 56% chance for someone whose parents rented.
That’s a pretty strong correlation, which makes what’s happening to millennials worth noting. Compared with Gen-Xers, those aged 19 to 34, are less likely than people of other age groups to have grown up in a home owned by their parents. This suggests that, millennials could be less likely to own a home when they reach prime home-buying age even before considering student debt burdens and lower wages for those who hit the labor market during the recession.
To be sure, homeownership is not without financial risks and is not the only way to store and generate wealth, nor is it even the best. In a world of limitless ways to spend money though, homeownership has remained reliable means of forced savings, even during the tumultuous past decade.
In studying parental influence and homeownership, we also found:
Among people of the same age and household income, those that were raised in homes that their parents owned are 2.9 times more likely to own themselves as those that were raised in homes that their parents rented, after excluding anyone who received financial help from their parents.
If you’re 27, don’t still live with your parents, and live in a lower to middle income household the chances you own your home are greater, 25.8% vs 10.7%, than your counterparts who grew up in a rented home.
Among those that grew up mostly in owned homes 58.3% have received some kind of financial assistance from their parents compared to just 32.3% for those who grew up in primarily in rentals. More than one out of 10 adults, 11.4%, whose parents owned have received assistance from them with a down payment while just 2.6% who grew up in rental housing got down payment assistance.
53.1% of millennials (ages 19 through 34) grew up in owned households, compared with 58.9% of those aged 35 through 45.; When it comes to homeownership it’s not just family that matters. Money, of course, does too. Adults who received no financial assistance from their parents since turning 18 were less likely to own a home than those who did. But even among adults who haven’t received any financial assistance, those who grew up in an owned home were still more likely to own themselves. Someone who is 25 years old and has a household income of $40,000 has roughly a 12% chance of owning a home if their parents rented during all of that person’s childhood. This same 25 year old would have a 29% chance of owning a home if their parents owned during their childhood. A 40 year old with the same income has a 28% chance of owning a home if their parents rented while the same person would have a 53% chance of owning if their parents owned their home.
As income increases childhood housing status begins to have less of an impact on chances of ownership. At very high incomes, the difference narrows to a few percentage points. Someone who is 25 and has a household income of $100,000 has a 57% chance of owning if their parents owned and a 32% chance if not. A 40 year old in a $100,000 annual income household, has an 79% chance of owning if their parents owned and 56% chance if not. In a $250,000-income household, someone who is 40 has a 90% chance of owning even if their parents rented when they were young, and a 96% chance of owning if their parents did own.; Of all the independent adults in the survey 50.1% have received some kind of financial assistance from their parents and 8.6% have received help making a down payment in particular. With each year that goes by a person has higher chance of being married or divorced, starting their first real job or get a significant promotion, and all the while similarly, their chances of them having had parents help them make a down payment on a home at some point increases steadily. There is stark difference in those cumulative chances between those that grew up mostly in owned homes and those that did not though. Young millennials (18 through 24) in either group are not likely to have received help making a down payment yet. 2.8% of those from owned homes receive down payment assistance during this time while 1.5% of those from rented homes say the same.
Among older millennials though (25 through 34), the chances of those from owned homes receiving down payment help jumps up to 8.5% while those from rented homes barely moves at 2.2%. Lastly, among the older group in the study (35 through 45), 18.5% from owned homes report having received help making a down payment at some point since turning 18, while only 3.8% of those who spent most of their childhood in rented homes can say the same.
Just 50% of younger millennials in the study, ages 19 through 24, spent the majority of their childhood in owned homes. In comparison, older millennials, ages 25 through 34, and younger Gen Xers, ages 35 through 45, and grew up in mostly owned homes at rates of 56% and 59%, respectively. This downward trend could have a lingering cooling effect on future generations’ propensity to buy.; The census bureau recently released a preliminary national Q2 2016 ownership rate of 62.9%, the lowest level since 1965, and a continuing decline since 2005. In addition to this, younger millennials in particular are more likely to have been raised in renter households and, following the recession, parents are probably less able to help children purchase their first home than they were in the past.

Until now, housing and homeownership haven’t been at the forefront of this year’s political cycle. But the vacancy survey has elicited a rise out of the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.

American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% – lowest rate in 51yrs. WE will bring back the ‘American Dream!’ pic.twitter.com/yI4Q8FHRjp
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2016

As for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee issued a $25 billion housing plan that, among other proposals, would provide down payment assistance to middle- and lower-income households.
These considerations could be pointing to a new “normal” homeownership rate that is lower than we are used to seeing for some time to come. It is important to keep in mind that this is all unfolding amid a housing policy that already disproportionately helps the wealthy and non-minorities. If we are buying into the adage that “no one washes a rental car” and apply that to housing as a reason for incentivizing ownership, it seems like a good time to reexamine the effects those incentives have on savings and the role of homeownership as it relates to wealth accumulation and disparities.; The analysis for this report was done entirely with Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data. Using the 2013 Individual File and a 2013 mapping of individuals to their biological or adoptive parents (FIMS), all adults (ages 19 through 45) were mapped back to their families from 1968 through 2011. From there, it was determined how many years of responses were available for each individual’s childhood (age 0 to 18) and how many of those years were spent in owned homes vs rented homes. Data from the 2013 Rosters and Transfers survey was then added to determine who had received different kinds of financial help from their parents since turning 18.
The primary model used to measure the impact of parent’s ownership status on children as they move into adulthood was a logistic regression model that controlled for just age, income and the proportion of their childhood that the person spent in home(s) owned by their parents while they were growing up. The only respondents included in the model A) had a at least 6 years of responses available from when they were children, B) Claim to have lived with their parents for at least 16 years of their childhood, C) have moved on to become the head of their own household or are married to the head of a household, and D) reported that neither they themselves nor their spouse (when applicable) have received any financial support from their parents for school, a down payment on a home, or “Other Financial Help” since turning 18.
The proportion of people who receive financial assistance from their parents was calculated suing the same group as above, but without eliminating those who had receiving any financial support from parents. When looking at the proportion of adults who lived in owned homes during the majority of their childhood, the requirement of already having to have left home and started their own households was also lifted.

fchacon,Where the Nation Vacations: The Hottest Markets for Second Homes,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/vacation-nation/,2016-07-14,"As summer kicks into high gear, Trulia is taking its regular look at vacation areas. This year we’re digging into which vacation hot spots are becoming more popular for second homes, and which are being ditched in favor of sandier beaches. We also looked into where people from the largest 100 metros are vacationing on the cheap and where they are spending big.
In addition to looking at the most searched vacation zip codes[1] nationally, we also used U.S. Census and Trulia search traffic data to create a list of the areas that are turning into vacation retreats (or into bigger vacation areas) at the fastest rate and those that have stabilized or even seem to be moving the other direction. We found:
Since our last look at the top 20 vacation-home destinations three years ago, the three most expensive areas – Harvey Cedars, N.J., East Hampton, N.Y. and Nantucket, Mass. – have dropped completely off the list. All of the new top 20 most searched areas have a median listing price of less than $600,000.
Locations in and around Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Florida dominate vacation-area home searches even more now, making up 9 of the top 20 places, up from 6 of the top 20 three years ago.
McGaheysville, Va., and McCall, Idaho, are among the top hot-spot places that have added vacation properties and rapidly increasing search interest from the previous year.
The most expensive of these growing vacation areas is Vashon Island, Wash., near Seattle, which had a median listing price of $529,000 during the past year.
Priced out: vacation destinations scoring the lowest in our hot-spot ranking were 31% more expensive on average than the places at the top of the list. These more expensive places included areas in the Hamptons, N.Y., and the Florida Keys.
People from more northern, colder cities consistently search for homes in vacation areas that are further south and warmer as searchers from cities such as Chicago, Indianapolis, Ind., Akron, OH, Detroit, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y. all have several Florida and Coastal-Carolina search destinations in their top 10. Those who are already living in warm climates are either searching for vacation homes in other warm areas or in the mountain areas such as Albuquerque, N.M. El Paso, Texas, Austin, Texas, New Orleans and Birmingham, Ala.
While not the most searched vacation areas in terms of raw volume, these are the areas that rank the highest when considering a combination of year-over-year change in search interest and an estimate of how quickly the proportion of the overall housing stock is shifting to seasonal or occasional use.
[1] Vacation home destinations were identified by zip codes. For the purposes of this report we have identified the closest town, city, or in some cases, county. Zip codes can be found in the tables and in our downloadable spreadsheet.; Top 20 Hot-Spot Vacation Areas

$344,900; If you look at the top 10 vacation destinations that are being searched the most from each metro area and what the high and low median price points are among these areas, you get a sense of where locals who can spend big are heading and where those on a budget can get away.
While the most popular vacation destination for New Yorkers is East Hampton, N.Y., based on search activity, the most expensive go-to spot is the Southampton, N.Y., area, where the median listing price has been $1.95 million during the past year. Their least expensive go-to spot is the Poconos Mountains region, near Bushkill in Eastern Pennsylvania. The median listing price during the past year in this area has been just over $81,000, less than 5% of the median price in Southampton.; San Francisco residents are searching, first and foremost, in Truckee, Calif., where the median listing price for a for-sale home has been $577,115 during the past year. This compares with a median listing price of $1.65 million in Carmel-By-The-Sea, Calif., south of Monterey, Calif., which is the most expensive vacation area that is frequently searched by people in San Francisco. Residents of the City by the Bay who are looking for a vacation home that won’t break the bank are directing their attentions to the Groveland, Calif., area in the Sierra Nevada foothills. The median listing price here has been $239,600 during the past year.; Seven of the top 10 vacation areas searched from people in Chicago are found in warm and sunny Florida. The most pricey spot in Chicagoans’ lineup is the Marco Island area of Florida which is south of Cape Coral. The median listing price during the past year in this area has been $569,000. When looking for more of a bargain, Windy City residents search for homes in Gatlinburg, near the Great Smokey Mountains, where the median listing price is a more modest $179,900. The single most popular area though is a bit closer to home and has had a median listing price of $394,000 during the past year. Grand Beach, Mich., on the shores of Lake Michigan, seems like the place to get away for a weekend.; Los Angeles residents don’t like to venture far from home as all 10 of their top searched vacation zip codes are within 200 miles of the city. The most frequently searched area is around Lake Arrowhead (92352) where the median listing price has been $399,000. The Rancho Mirage, Calif. area, in Coachella Valley, is the most expensive place with a median listing price of $499,000 for the past year. The cheapest place in the top 10 is Arrowbear Lake coming in at $189,500.; While Chicagoans are looking to escape the cold, the most pricey spot Houston residents head for is in the mountains. Breckenridge, Colo., with a median listing price of $675,000 is the fifth most popular vacation area being searched by Houstonians. Their No. 1 most searched spot is Rockport, Texas, where the median listing price is $245,329. And while people from Houston won’t be meeting their friends from Chicago in Breckenridge, they do also turn to Gatlinburg for a more affordable getaway.; To determine which zip codes are becoming more popular as vacation destinations at the quickest rates, we looked at a combination of trended U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) data and more recent Trulia search traffic data. From the ACS we trended 2011 5-year data to 2014 5-year data to determine which zip codes had the largest average increases (or decreases) in seasonal vacant units. To be included in the ranking, each zip code had to have at least 3,000 housing units and 5% of the overall stock vacant because they were for seasonal or occasional use. We then combined that with the percent change in search activity each of these zip codes received during the 3-months ending June 1, 2016 to the same period a year earlier and ranked them based on these two metrics. Only searches for homes in vacation ZIP codes outside the searcher’s own metro area were counted as vacation searches.
When looking at what the top 10 vacation zip codes searched from each metro area, we defined vacation areas are ZIP codes with at least 3,000 housing units and where at least 25% of housing units are for seasonal or occasional use (to focus on the more traditional search areas), according to the census. Again, we only counted searches as vacation searches if they were for homes in vacation ZIP codes outside the searcher’s own metro area. For this portion of the analysis, we assumed that the number of vacation-related searches to a ZIP code was proportional to the share of vacation homes in that area."
fchacon,Looking West: Chinese House Hunters Are Peeking at the U.S. Again,Home Searches,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/international-house-hunters-2016/,2016-06-02,"Chinese searches of U.S. homes are on the rise again, but searches out of India saw the biggest jump during the last year.; Less than a year after the Chinese stock market crash and its economy slumped, searches of U.S. properties from the Chinese mainland are on the rise – and the prices of properties they’re searching for are up too.
In Trulia’s semi-regular look at home searches by international house hunters, we’ve found that Canada still leads in the raw volume of search activity for for-sale homes in the U.S. from abroad, but the United Kingdom has closed the gap considerably. Meanwhile, Chinese for-sale search volume and the price of the homes they are looking at have largely rebounded, but still lag slightly when compared with all foreign searches.
The median price of homes searches from China tumbled from nearly $470,700 during the 3-months ending May 1, 2015 to $362,900 during the 3 months ending Nov. 1, 2015 as the Chinese stock market fell 25%. Since then though, while still down 4.8% from the previous year, the median price of homes searched has increased back up to nearly $448,300 during the 3 months ending May 1, 2016 despite a lack of recovery in its stock markets.
By comparison, the median price of the homes being viewed in all foreign searches for for-sale properties in the U.S. increased from $340,100 during the 3 months ending May 1 to $348,800 during the 3 months ending Nov. 1, 2015. It has since decreased slightly to $346,300 during the 3 months ending May 1, 2016, indicating a year-over-year increase of 1.8% from May 2015 to May 2016. Search volume for for-sale homes from China are down 10.7% from May 2015 to May 2016 while all foreign for-sale searches have increased by 13.8% during the same time.
Here are a few other highlights from our analysis:
The Chinese share of all foreign searches of for-sale homes has fallen from 1.0% last year to 0.8% this year. Rental search activity from China increased to 0.8% of rentals compared with 0.5% last year.
Canadian searches of for-sale properties make up 14.4% of all foreign searches compared with 17.9% last year. In rentals, Canada’s share is lower but growing at 11% compared with 9.0% the previous year.
Among the 10 countries with the most search activity on Trulia.com, traffic (for sale and rental) from India grew the most, by 47.0%, compared with last year. All international traffic grew by 13.8% during the same time.
Despite relatively low search volume, searchers from Yemen look at for-sale properties in Detroit at 42 times the rate you would expect them to given their national rate. Detroit also has 11,581 estimated Yemeni-born residents, or more than 1/4 of all Yemeni-born residents in the country.
Most home searchers from foreign countries search for places nearer to their home country geographically (thanks, Tobler). Searchers from Canada and Ireland do not follow this rule though, favoring areas in Florida and California, respectively.
During the 3-months ending May 1, 3.5% of all home searches (for-sale, rental and off-market) on Trulia.com came from outside the United States. This figure has been steadily decreasing since 2011 as domestic search activity has been growing more rapidly than international search activity. International search activity grew by 13.8% during the 3-month period ending May 1 when compared with the same period a year ago. This compares with roughly 38% growth from domestic users. Since we last analyzed traffic from abroad, the share of searches coming from Canada, which has always been the largest source of international activity, has continued to decline and the United Kingdom has nearly caught up. Most notably, for-sale search activity from Canada declined by 11.2% during the 3-months ending May 2016 while search activity from the U.K. increased by 11.4%, when compared with search volume for the same period a year ago.; Country

Includes rental and for-sale home searches; Most foreign searchers using Trulia gravitate to homes in a handful of well-known and/or large metros. But many areas see a disproportionate number of searches from a country, given that country’s overall share of search activity nationally. The following map shows disproportionate search scores for the top the countries by overall volume as well as a few countries that have outlying search patterns.
The metros that receive the most searches from Mexico in order of search volume are San Diego, Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Chicago. However, from the map, we see metros that are receiving the largest disproportionate share of searches from Mexico are El Paso, Texas, (23 times more than expected), San Diego (9.3), Tucson, Ariz., (5.4), San Antonio, Texas, (4.0), and Miami (2.9).

Searchers from South American countries on the other hand seem to really like the idea of living in Florida. All of Venezuela’s top 5 search locations are in Florida for example, with searches to Miami occurring at 22.7 times what you would expect given that county’s national search volume.

If you compare Detroit and Austin, Texas, two metros of similar size but different fortunes, Austin receives outsized attention from places like Zimbabwe (9.3), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (8.5), Kenya (3.5), Saudi Arabia (2.5), and Qatar (2.5) while Detroit receives the most disproportionate interest from Yemen (42.1), Lebanon (12.7), Trinidad and Tobago (4.6), Hong Kong (4.4), and Israel (3.6). In Austin, there are about half as many expats from Kenya and Saudi Arabia as you would expect given their national expat population, possibly indicating shifting interests. Detroit, in addition to have a disproportionally bigger population of people from Yemen, also has one of the largest Lebanese populations in the U.S., possibly explaining their interest in the metro.

Looking at San Jose, Calif., it receives the most outsized interest from Taiwan (17.4), Vietnam (14.0), China (8.8), Algeria (7.3), and Hong Kong (6.8). In San Jose, more than 10% of the population identify as being from either Taiwan, Vietnam, China, or Hong Kong.
Compare that to Milwaukee where the most outsized interest comes from the Palestinian Territory (2.7), Albania (2.3), Romania (1.8), Saint Lucia (1.8), and Israel (1.43) and only Albanians have a have a disproportionally large population of expats living in the metro.
 
Methodology
Search traffic is based on visits to active for-sale and for-rent properties on Trulia.com, Trulia mobile, and the Trulia app from February 1 to May 1, 2016. Year over year comparisons are use the same time frame. Search traffic volume from Nigeria and Bulgaria was highly volatile over the past eighteen months and was excluded from the analysis. Outsized search volumes by metro were calculated with the following formula: (expat_searchesmetro/all_searchesmetro)/(expat_searchesnational/all_searchesnational)
Using 5-year American Community Survey data, a similar formula was used to check if people from country X make up an outsized proportion of the population of metro Y: (expat_popmetro/all_popmetro)/(expat_popnational/all_popnational)"
fchacon,It Ain’t Easy Bein’ Green,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/it-aint-easy-bein-green/,2016-04-14,"By a wide margin, most Americans consider themselves to be environmentally conscious. But when it comes to walking the walk, some are more environmentally responsible than others.; With the hottest year on record behind us, January and February a warm memory and Earth Day right around the corner, we decided to gauge American attitudes on being environmentally responsible at home. In an online survey conducted in March 2016 by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia, we asked more than 2,000 Americans about what they thought were the best ways to live green.
The good news is that 79% of Americans agree that they consider themselves an environmentally conscious person, and only 6% strongly disagree with that statement. But as it turns out, it ain’t easy bein’ green. Only 26% of Americans say that they actually consider the environment in their daily actions beyond recycling and turning off the lights. Moreover, people have widely varying opinions on what’s the best way to reduce their home’s carbon footprint. When they do agree, it’s not always on the highest impact methods.
As we dug deeper into the national, political, and sociodemographic differences among U.S. adults, we found some interesting contrasts:
Among Americans who strongly agree that they are environmentally conscious, 73% said they consider the environment in their actions at least once a day.* This group was also much more likely practice what they preach when it came to actually being environmentally responsible.
A majority of Democrats and Republicans talk the environmental talk, with 85% of Democrats agreeing that they consider themselves environmentally conscious and Republicans not far behind at 74%. However, Democrats were more likely to walk the walk than Republicans when it comes to ever taking action based on environmental considerations (94% vs. 88%, respectively).
Boomers (ages 55+), are significantly more likely to act environmentally responsible by buying energy efficient appliances, making energy efficient upgrades to their homes and living in a smaller home than their younger cohorts (69% compared with 55% those ages 54 and younger).* Millennials (18-34 year olds), on the other hand, are more polarized on the issue than any other generation with the highest proportion strongly agreeing and disagreeing that they are environmentally conscious.
In general, as a person becomes more educated, so does the degree to which they consider themselves to be environmentally conscious (75% of those with a high school or less education, 79% of those with some college and 84% of those with a college degree or higher consider themselves an environmentally conscious person). But as the level of education increases, so does one’s income, home size and the storage space used* – the last two of which are environmental no-no.
Regardless of the degree to which Americans consider themselves environmentally conscious, many agree that the top three ways for someone to act environmentally responsibly are to buy energy efficient appliances for their home (56%), make energy efficient upgrades to their home (55%) and bike, walk, or take public transportation to frequented destinations (38%).
Curiously, what seem like easier, cheaper and higher impact actions like living in a smaller home (16%) and buying renewable electricity from a utility provider (10%) are not nearly as high on the list of ways to be environmentally responsible. Americans seem to agree: Buying energy efficient appliances for the home is among the best ways to be environmentally responsible, more so than living in smaller homes.
Yet money is a barrier to being environmentally responsible. While some Americans believe that installing solar panels (28%) and driving a hybrid or electric car (18%) are among the best ways for someone to be environmentally responsible, few actually do so themselves (12% and 12%, respectively). Trulia believes that this is likely a result of the larger initial investments required. Similarly, people are less willing to pay price premiums for energy efficient appliances as the baseline price gets more expensive even if it’s considered the best way to be environmentally responsible. For a $50 appliance or electronic, 76% of environmentally conscious Americans are willing to pay a premium for energy efficiency, followed by 58% of Americans who aren’t environmentally conscious.* But when the baseline prices starts at $2,000, those numbers drop to 53% and 36%, respectively.* As you can see from the table below, there are some big differences in what Americans believe are the best ways to be environmentally conscious versus what they actually do.

Political Differences
While an overwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats say they consider themselves environmentally conscious (85% and 74%, respectively), there were some differences in enthusiasm and behavior. Significantly more Democrats strongly agreed that they consider themselves environmentally conscious at 28% compared with 12% among Republicans. Moreover, 44% of Democrats say they consider the environment at least daily in their actions while just 31% of Republicans say the same.
When asked what the best way to act environmentally responsible is, Republicans were much more home-centric while Democrats were more focused on transportation. Comparatively, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say making energy efficient upgrades to their home is among the best ways to be environmentally responsible (62% vs. 54%, respectively), while Democrats were more likely to say biking, walking, or taking public transportation (45% vs. 27%, respectively) and driving hybrid or electric vehicles (19% vs. 14%, respectively).
However, Democrats tend to actually act environmentally responsible at a higher rates than Republicans. So while 62% of Republicans say making energy efficient upgrades to the home is one of the best ways for someone to be environmentally responsible, only 53% actually do so. Democrats, conversely, do actually bike, walk or take public transportation at a higher rate than Republicans (42% vs. 26%, respectively) and are also more likely to drive hybrid or electric vehicles (15% vs. 10%, respectively).

Socio-demographic Differences
Attitudes towards green living also varied considerably across different age groups, but surprisingly, Millennials and Gen X’ers were not America’s most environmentally conscious generation. More Americans aged 65 years or older (84%) consider themselves to be environmentally conscious than 18-34 year olds (76%) and 35-54 year olds (78%).
Another contrast: Millennials are the most polarized age group when it comes to being environmentally conscious, with the highest proportion of respondents who strongly disagree (8%) versus strongly agree (24%). Millennials are also the only age group with significant differences between men and women. More Millennial men (32%), strongly agree that they are environmentally conscious, than millennial women (17%). Meanwhile, 29% of millennial women actually disagreed compared with 19% of millennial men.

But intentions aside, Boomers, aged 55 or older, actually take actions specifically based on environmental considerations, beyond recycling and turning off the lights, on a daily basis or more at a rate of 44% compared with 34% for the rest of the population.* Some of the environmentally responsible activities that they reported doing at higher rates than younger cohorts included buying energy efficient appliances (69% compared with 55% those younger than 55), and making energy efficient upgrades to their home (58% compared with 47% for those younger than 55), which require more of a monetary investment.* Meanwhile, 18-34 year olds chose more cost-effective green activities than their older counterparts, such as biking, walking or taking public transportation (47% compared with 31% for those 35+), and carpooling to frequent destinations (34% compared with 18% for those 35+).*

Aside from age, education also plays a big factor in living green. Americans with a college degree are more likely to say that they consider themselves environmentally conscious (84%) compared with those with a high school education or less (75%). Among this more educated group of Americans, more believe driving a hybrid or electric vehicle (22%) is among the best ways for someone to be environmentally responsible than their less educated peers who have a high school education or less (16%).
As education increases, so does household income and overall consumption.* Americans with a higher education tend live in larger homes and use more spaces for storage of stuff*, despite that being an environmental no-no. Larger homes require more raw materials to produce and more energy to maintain than smaller homes. Similarly, all that idle stuff being stored in dedicated rooms required raw materials and energy to produce and ship at one point. Even just among those who somewhat or strongly agree they are environmentally conscious, 40% with a college degree or more live in home larger than 2,000 square feet versus 21% of those with a high school education or less.* When asked where theye stored miscellaneous “stuff” (e.g., old clothes, old books, holiday decorations, second refrigerator or freezer), 67% of Americans with a high school education or less report having no more than two dedicated storage spaces in their home, versus 55% of those with more education.*

Note: Based on Trulia Analysis of the survey findings
Based on the survey findings, we here at Trulia believe that most people want to do what is best for the environment, but there are clear time, convenience, and cost limitations that are also evident from responses. The degree to which these limitations push people away from a more green way of living is strongly affected by how they agree or disagree that they are environmentally conscious.* If changing minds on the environment is hard, then changing behavior is even harder. But ultimately, the answer to global environmental problems probably won’t come in the form high efficiency washers and TVs. Instead it will come more from collective changes in personal choices and behavior and improved efficiency. As it relates to housing, this involves careful consideration of where you live relative where you work, play and learn, how much space is enough and what you fill that space with.
*Based on custom analysis of survey findings by Trulia
Full Methodology
This survey was conducted online within the United States between March 16th and 18th, 2016 among 2,015 adults (aged 18 and over) by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia via its Quick Query omnibus product. Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online.
All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, the words “margin of error” are avoided as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal.
Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in our panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated."
fchacon,"Minorities, Women Losing Out on Homeownership and Tax Breaks",Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/minorities-women-mortgage/,2016-04-12,"Even when they make as much as white men, our analysis suggests women and minorities are still less likely to have a mortgage.; Women and minorities who identify as the head of their household still aren’t borrowing to buy homes at the same rate of men and whites[1], respectively, even when they make the same income. As a result, they’re not only less likely to be homeowners, but are also locked out of one of the biggest tax benefits available annually.
That benefit, of course, is the mortgage interest tax deduction (MITD). In 2013 alone, taxpayers saved – and the U.S. Treasury lost — $80 billion as a result of the deduction.
The MITD is known to benefit higher income taxpayers – who are more likely able to buy homes and itemize their deductions. Only 12% of tax filers with less than $50,000 adjusted gross income (AGI) actually do, compared with 94% with $200,000 or more AGI, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And among all tax filers, nearly half – 49% — of the value of their itemized deductions is housing-related, which includes home mortgage interest, real estate taxes and a few other small deductions like deductible mortgage points and qualified mortgage insurance premiums.
So as a tax break for mostly higher income households, white heads of households are more than 3 times as likely to be eligible to claim the deduction than black heads of households and women are 31% less likely than men to be eligible to claim it.
One possible explanation for the disparity in mortgage borrowing and, in turn, homeownership is age and income. Most minority groups and women have lower incomes on average than whites and men, respectively, and are therefore less likely to take out a mortgage to buy a home – let alone take advantage of MITD. But is the MITD just a tax policy that benefits the wealthy? If we strip away those factors, are women and minorities still less likely to have mortgages than their white male counterparts?
To find out, we examined a big slice of U.S. households using the Census’ 2014 American Community Survey, accounted for age and income effects and looked at who had borrowed to buy a home. In other words we created an even playing field where race, ethnicity and gender were the only criteria separating the potential mortgage holder. So by age, income and geography our study group was the same. Nationally, we found:
After controlling for age and income, blacks are still 56.9% less likely to own a home with a mortgage than whites. Blacks generally compared more favorably in Florida, California, and Texas and less so in Northeast and Midwest.
With exceptions, the chances of a minority having a mortgage tend to be higher in cities where heads of households of that minority group make up a large share of the overall population. For instance, in Honolulu – where Japanese Americans make up 20% of all households – they are twice as likely to own as white households.
In the San Francisco Bay Area cities, Chinese Americans are twice as likely to have a mortgage as whites, but 38.9% less likely to have a mortgage nationally.
Hispanics are 50.9% less likely than whites to have a mortgage, but are more likely to own with a mortgage at the same rate or better in the Southwest and West. Hispanics in El Paso are more than twice as likely to have a mortgage as whites and make up more than 75% of all households.
Single women are 6.2% less likely to own a home with a mortgage than single men, but had mortgages at a greater rate than men in San Antonio, Raleigh, N.C., Seattle, Denver and Tacoma, Wash., to name a few.
On the national level, controlling for age and income does not seem to account for much of the overall difference in the chances of having a home with a mortgage between racial and ethnic groups and whites. Why is this? For minorities, one reason why the gap is so large is the lack of intergenerational wealth transfers. Minorities have less access to financial assistance on down payments from relatives and are more likely to be in financial trouble when unexpected expenses arise. However, intergenerational wealth transfers were not factored into this analysis as they are difficult to measure.

As far as the gender gap goes, much of it is explained by age and income. Women do much better compared with men after controlling for age and income, but still fall short by 10.5%. This is likely because woman who identify as a head of household on Census forms are much more likely to be single than married. Meanwhile, men identify as head of households much more often than women in married households, and married households are significantly more likely own a home with a mortgage than single households.
So given the quirky ways in which married couples respond to census forms, we looked at just single, never-married women and men instead. When you control for age and income with this group, women are 6.2% less likely to get a mortgage than men. The gap is completely eliminated when we control for the number of children the head of household is raising. This is because 11.7 % of single men report having children while 37.2% of single women say the same. Many of these singles are likely shouldering a disproportionate share of the financial costs of raising children and this puts homeownership out of reach for many of them.

This suggests that the narrative of the MITD simply being a policy that primarily benefits the wealthy is only part of the story. If differences in which groups can take advantage of the MITD can’t be explained by age and income, then in addition to fueling wealth disparities between rich and poor, the policy is also increasing wealth disparities between racial and ethnic groups among heads of households who are otherwise similar. Nationally, if you are a head of a household and you are any race or ethnicity other than white, you are between 38.8% and 57.8% less likely to be able to take advantage of the MITD than a white head of household of the same age and income. 
 
Blacks Still 56.9% Less Likely to Own a Home with a Mortgage than WhitesLooking at the metro-level, blacks in Madison, Wis., are 90.5% less likely to own a home than a whites of the same age and income. This means that if the two population groups were the same size, for every one black head of household, there would be 10 white heads of households of the same income and age claiming MITD. On the other end, black people in Miami, Fla., are 14.6% less likely than white people to own a home; the smallest statistically significant difference between blacks and whites in the comparison.
Of the top 100 metros, there is not one where blacks are more likely to own a home with a mortgage than a white person even after controlling for age and income, based on this sample. The only metro where we cannot say with confidence* that a black person is less likely than a white person to own is in Albuquerque, NM, though this is primarily because blacks made up only 2% of the sampled households in Albuquerque.

In SF Bay Area, Chinese Americans Twice as Likely to have a Mortgage as Whites
Nationally, Chinese Americans are 38.8% less likely to own a home with a mortgage than whites of the same age and income. From metro to metro, this figure varies considerably. Of the metros with some of the larger Chinese populations, where the difference is statistically significant, they are anywhere from 3 to 5 as likely to qualify for the MITD as whites (Las Vegas and Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla.,), to 95.3% less likely (Syracuse, N.Y.). In the two cities with the largest Chinese population, New York and Los Angeles, they are 4.8% less likely and 89.8% more likely to own, respectively. Chinese mortgage holder rates in San Francisco Bay Area cities are on par with Los Angeles.

Hispanics More Likely to Own with a Mortgage in the Southwest and West
There are seven metros in the analysis where Hispanics are more likely to own a home than whites. These places include, El Paso, Texas, Albuquerque, N.M., San Francisco, and Tucson, Ariz. In El Paso for example, a Hispanic person is more than twice as likely as a white person to own a home and have a mortgage, and therefore claim the MITD. In Birmingham, Ala., and Boston on the other hand, Hispanics are 71.3% less likely to own than whites.

Single Women Are 6.2% Less Likely to Own a Home with a Mortgage
Among single, never married men and women in the top 100 metros, the homeownership rates between household heads of the two groups are not statistically different in 63 of them after controlling for age and income. Of the metros where there are measurable differences between the two groups, fifteen of them show that women are more likely than men to have a mortgage, including San Antonio (45.7%), Raleigh, N.C. (17.9%), Seattle (20.7%) and Denver (10.4%).
Meanwhile, in 22 of the 100 largest metros, men were much more likely to own then women. This includes Allentown, Pa., and Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., where women are 36.4% and 23.5% less likely than men to own a home after controlling for age and income. These are largest gender difference in the 100-metro comparison.

The MITD not only offers a tax benefit to predominantly wealthier households, it also disproportionally provides a tax benefit to whites or men of the same age and income as their non-white or women peers. While the MITD is meant to incentivize home ownership, our findings suggest it may also be exacerbating racial, ethnic and gender wealth disparities.
So what are the policy implications? With minority groups still at a substantial disadvantage in the housing market, a more ideal tax policy would at least do no harm when it comes to existing wealth disparities. Two possible ways to do this are to (1) eliminate or to (2) change the mortgage interest tax deduction. There is no shortage of ideas on how best to do this. One possibility would be to turn the deduction into more of a housing tax credit that would go to mortgage holders AND renters regardless of whether or not they itemize. However, both of these options would face strong political opposition and are unlikely to happen in the near future. 
[1] For the purposes of this report, we refer to the census designation of “non-Hispanic whites” as “whites.”
Methodology
To come up with the figures above, we used non group-quarter 5-year 2014 American Community Survey household-level microdata (IPUMS – Steven Ruggles, Katie Genadek, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, and Matthew Sobek. Integrated Public Use Microdata Series: Version 6.0 [Machine-readable database]. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2015.), as well as a PUMA to County equivalency file from the Missouri Census Data Center to weight household level responses appropriately based on geography and survey weight provided in the IPUMS data. After that, all households that were owned free-and-clear or that were in a cash-free rent arrangement were dropped from the sample, leaving only traditional renters and owners with a mortgage.
To compute how different groups’ ownership/mortgage status compared to that of non-Hispanic whites (or men for the gender comparison) before controlling for age and income, an indicator variable was created to identify whether or not the household was an owner household (with mortgage) or not, and odds ratios were calculated. To control for age and income, we used the following logistic regression models for each metro:
For the race comparison, all Hispanics were dropped from the sample and race was treated as a factor.
own_indicator = HHincome + HHincome^2 + age + age^2 + race
For the ethnicity comparison, only Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites were kept in the sample and an indicator was created based on whether or not the respondent was Hispanic or not
own_indicator = HHincome + HHincome^2 + age + age^2 + hisp_indicator
For the gender comparison, only household heads who identified as “Single, Never Married” were compared and just the gender factor was used in addition to age and income
own_indicator = HHincome + HHincome^2 + age + age^2 + gender
A 0.10 level of statistical significance was used for all coefficients."
fchacon,Sin Cities And Saintly Sanctuaries,Livability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/sin-cities/,2016-02-03,"Mardi Gras is around the corner, we’ve found America’s most sinful – and saintly – cities.; In the spirit of Fat Tuesday excess, we ranked America’s most sinful cities and their saintly counterparts. We crafted our list by using the seven deadly sins of lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, and vanity, or pride.
For each sin we looked at the characteristics. For instance, for lust we measured how many adult entertainment venues a city had per resident, and for sloth, we used surveys about exercise. Finally, we aggregated the data from all sins to create our top list of sin cities and saintly sanctuaries.
So, whether you want to indulge in forbidden pleasures or do good and avoid temptation, we crunched the numbers for you. Here’s where you are most and least likely to be in good company, either indulging or avoiding the seven deadly sins.
New Orleans still reigns as king of Mardi Gras. With nearly three times the national rate of adult entertainment establishments and twice the number gambling establishments per household, it scores highly in lust and greed. Additionally, above average rates of smoking, binge- and heavy-drinking and obesity, as well as high incidents of violent crime make the Crescent City a great place for those looking to explore gluttony and wrath.

If vanity or pride is your vice of choice, head to the Golden State, where all of the top five cites in this category can be found. Orange County, Calif. tops the list with more than four times the national number of plastic surgeon offices per household. Los Angeles is a close second, with 3.3 times the national number of plastic surgeon offices per household. Both cities also have around twice as many beauty and tanning salons as the national per household rate. Other cities cracking the top ten most prideful are Austin and Salt Lake City. They have your narcissistic needs covered with above average rates of beauty salons, tanning salons and plastic surgeon offices.

If you’re tired of being surrounded with souls plagued by envy, head to El Paso, Texas, where the difference in the listing price of homes between the 25th and 75th percentile as a proportion of its median listing price, is the smallest at one-third the average of the 150 city comparison. Also on the list of least envious places is Fargo, ND and Anchorage, Alaska, with listing price differences 30% and 26% lower than average. Fairfield County, Conn. and Detroit, Mich., have the largest difference in home listing prices as a proportion of their median listing price, at 65% and 58% above the comparison average, making them the most envious places in our comparison. New York and Philadelphia, not to be outdone, also come in at 42% and 32% above the national average.

Lastly for the greedy among us, Billings, Mont., offers more than 54 times the national average number of casinos per household, shooting it to the top of our list. Of the other top 10 cities, in addition to having plenty of casinos, Atlantic City residents claimed the lowest amount of charitable contributions on their itemized tax filings in 2013, keeping them high on our greedy list. You won’t find a single race track or casino in Provo, on the hand, and residents claim to donate nearly 10 percent of their income to charitable causes, making them the least greedy in our comparison.

MethodologyIn the creation of our Vice Index, we took a hedonic1 approach. We use the seven deadly sins, or cardinal sins, codified by Pope Gregory I in 590. The seven individual sin categories were first indexed and then ranked. The overall rankings were based off of the average rank of each the seven sin indexes per metro area. The seven individual sin category indexes are composed of the following inputs: 
Lust: Yelp-defined Adult Entertainment Establishments per 10,000 households.
Gluttony: A composite of metro-level Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on obesity rates, binge-drinking2 rates, heavy drinking3 rates, and smoking rates.
Greed: Yelp-defined horse and/or dog racing and gambling establishments per 10,000 households and county-level IRS charitable contributions data from itemized tax filings. 
Sloth: Metro-level CDC data on proportion of residents who report having not exercised at least once in the past 30 days.
Wrath: Violent crime data per capita as reported in FBI crime statistics
Envy: The difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles of listing prices as a proportion of the median listing price in each metro area
Vanity: Yelp-defined beauty and tanning salons, as well as plastic surgery offices per 10,000 households
1 Hedonic – of, relating to, or characterized by pleasure
2 Binge drinking is when men consume 5 or more drinks, and women consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.
3 For men, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming 15 drinks or more per week. For women, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming 8 drinks or more per week."
fchacon,Turnaround Towns…And Towns Stuck In the Downturn,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/turnaround-towns/,2015-12-09,"Since housing prices bottomed nationally at the start of 2012, the fortunes of homeowners and renters have varied widely based on where they live.; For many U.S. housing markets it’s been a tale of two recoveries. Nearly four years after housing prices hit bottom nationally, some metro areas have seen big gains in employment, wages, housing prices. Others have seen sluggish economic growth and lagging prices. Still others have seen a seen a mix – booming employment and lagging housing market or vice versa.
We’ve crunched the numbers and asked the question: Where were the best and worst places to rent or buy since the housing market bottomed out? To create our list we factored in more than just housing prices. We looked into job prospects, wages, vacancy rates, home values or how much rent has increased to determine what places offered the best opportunities.
What we found was a wide spectrum.
Whether you’re a renter or an owner, strong gains in the economy have helped North Carolina cities stand out as being a strong area for both renters and owners since 2012.
New Orleans’ struggles with anemic job and wage growth have hampered home value appreciation. Meanwhile, the Crescent City’s available housing pool has declined faster than the national average, making it more expensive and difficult to find places for rent.
Cities hardest hit by the recession — Las Vegas, Detroit and Sarasota, Fla., among them — haven’t been particularly favorable for either owners or renters.
San Francisco Bay Area cities as well as places like Denver, Seattle, and Houston, driven by consistently strong labor market fundamentals, have been great places to have bought a home in 2012 – but what’s surprising is that despite rising rents, these market’s strong job and wage growth have made them good places to rent relative to other cities.
 

Rounding out the list of the top 10 cities for homeowners, are places like West Palm Beach, Fla. and Anaheim, Calif.. West Palm Beach was particularly hard-hit by the recession between 2008 and 2010. Since 2012, home values have been appreciating at nearly double the average in the rest of the comparison.

While all of this price appreciation has failed to restore home values to their previous peak, labor market fundamentals have also been favorable in West Palm Beach, even compared with other cites that experienced a similarly steep employment decline during the recession. Broad job gains in multiple sectors have boosted the area. On the other side of the country, in Anaheim a similar story has unfolded, with prices not quite back to their pre-recession level, but strong labor market fundamentals and a declining vacancy rate creating better returns for those who bought homes after the recession.

Rental markets are a different story. The things that make great ownership towns — rapid price appreciation and declining vacancy rates – tend to make them tougher places to rent. Rental markets need ample inventories and strong economies. Winston-Salem, N.C., despite having employment growth below the average 6.5%, has been the best city for renters based on its strong wage growth and modest rent increase during the past three years. Charlotte, and Raleigh both appear in the top 10 lists for owners and renters. While both have experienced rental price increases above the average of 9.2% in the comparison, and declining vacancy rates, these burdens have been fairly forgiving compared with other cities experiencing similarly steep drops in the unemployment rate and rising wages since 2012. Also, in Austin, Texas, despite experience rapid rental price appreciation, renters have benefited from strong job and wage growth, and a vacancy rate that has increased since 2012, though it is still a fairly tight market.

On the flip side, New Orleans’ slower-than-average employment and wage growth combined with a falling vacancy rate and average rent growth have made for a fairly uncomfortable set of circumstances for renters. New Orleans made it through the recession relatively unscathed compared with other cities, as the area was still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina. But as much of the rest of the country has recovered from job losses and continued to expand, employment growth in New Orleans has lagged behind. Manufacturing and construction sector job losses, partially spurred by low oil prices and declining oil and gas construction activity have offset some of the broad gains in the service providing sectors. Also on this list are Los Angeles and Washington D.C.; Los Angeles because of rising rents, slow wage growth, and a rapidly declining vacancy rate, and DC primarily because of uninspiring overall labor market improvements.

Cities like Albuquerque, N.M.; Gary, Ind.; and Silver Spring, Md., were some of the worst places to own post-housing bottom. All of the cities on this list have performed below average on both labor market metrics and housing market metrics. In Albuquerque, for example, home of Sandia National Laboratory, Kirtland Air Force Base, and the University of New Mexico, the government sector comprises nearly 21% of all employment compared with 14% nationally. With tight state, local and federal budgets, a more robust employment expansion has been hampered since prior to 2012. In Gary, Ind., slow employment growth and net out migration during the past two years have kept home value appreciation to a minimum. Silver Spring on the other hand, has seen moderate price appreciation since 2012, but the vacancy rate has been climbing steadily and labor market improvements have been modest.

Additionally, since 2012, we expected to see some of the most favorable market conditions for new owners in the markets that were most impacted by the recession. That connection seems to be fairly weak though. Of the 10 cities that lost the most jobs as a percentage of their initial employment from 2008 to 2010, only West Palm Beach, FL also appears as a top place for owners. Northport, FL; Toledo, OH; and Detroit, MI; which all had lost more than 10% of their overall employment between 2008 and 2010, have not experienced the same rebound as much of the rest of the country. Rather than indicating a story of bust followed by recovery-driven boom, these indexes seem to show a picture of shifting fortunes.
 
MethodologyWhile both owners and renters can appreciate the benefits of improving labor market conditions, they likely have different ideas of what constitutes a favorable housing market. Owners are happiest when vacancy rates are declining and home values are on the rise. Renters have more leverage when vacancy rates are increasing and rent prices are flat or falling. But rising vacancy rates and falling rents are not often seen in areas with heady labor market fundamentals, and low rent and high vacancy rates don’t do you much good if you can’t find and keep a good job. 
In the creation of our owner and renter indexes, we looked at several key metrics on the 100 largest U.S. metro areas. First, we combined three components of labor market data with vacancy and price metrics as a way to weight the importance of being able to find/keep a job in an area with increasing pay more heavily than housing availability and price appreciation. Wage, covered employment, and unemployment rate data were pulled from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics’ (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) and Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) programs. The 4-quarter rolling average was taken for all the BLS metrics and then each metro was ranked and scored based on the percent change from the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2015, the most recent data available. To gauge changes in the vacancy rate of both the sales and rental housing market, the percent change in the United States Postal Service vacancy rate by metro was ranked and scored. For the rental index though, vacancy rate increases were treated as improvements, while in the owner index, vacancy rate decreases were treated as improvements. 
Finally, the percent change in the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) by metro was used to rank and score on price appreciation for the owner’s perspective, where larger price increases, were assigned better ranks & scores. For the renter’s perspective, the Zillow Rent Index (ZRI) was used to rank and score each metro on rental price appreciation, where larger price increases since 2012 were assigned worse ranks and scores.
An aggregated score and rank was then calculated for each metro for both the owner index and the renter index separately, resulting in the overall indexes discussed here."
david,Mortgage Complaints: Who You Gonna Call?,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/cfpb-complaints/,2017-04-19,"After nearly a decade and more than 6 million foreclosures since the start of the housing crash, the Trump administration is set to review a key agency that aids home borrowers with loan disputes.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) opened in July 2011, and the agency reported that in its first five years it has returned more than $11.8 billion from financial institutions on behalf of 29 million consumers. That tally includes money recovered by consumers through CFPB dispute resolution.
In February, President Donald Trump ordered a review of Dodd-Frank and the CFPB. And just last week, he reiterated his intention to streamline, or even “eliminate” all or part of the law. Congress also is considering a bill that would change the CFPB’s leadership, size and mission.
That could be a blow for thousands of mortgage borrowers who have used the CFPB’s dispute resolution to act as an intermediary in their cases. Borrowers can file a claim when a payment isn’t posted or is erroneously posted late, when a bank moves to foreclose without notice or when they want to dispute charges – anything really. The borrowers don’t always win, but the CFPB offers the much-needed guidance and consumer protection that was sorely lacking a decade ago.
With this critical piece of post-crisis regulation under review, we take a look at the CFPB’s impact in the mortgage market. We examine where consumers have asked the bureau for help in resolving mortgage disputes, who’s doing the asking and what types of loans the CFPB deals with the most. We found:
Nationally, the CFPB has handled 224,796 home loan complaints, or about 42,000 a year, since the bureau started tracking complaints on Dec. 1, 2011. This represents 0.46% of all outstanding mortgages as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Miami, (1.6% of all mortgages held in the zip code), Asheville, N.C., (1.53%), and Atlanta, (1.46%), zip codes have the highest rates of mortgage complaints at the CFPB. The New York metro has three zip codes with high complaint rates that land in the top 10: New Rochelle, (1.25%), Far Rockaway (1.23%) and New York City (1.14%) itself.
Disputes about FHA, VA and reverse mortgages have more than doubled since 2012.
Older Americans (62 and older) and military service members combined make up 15% of all complaints. Broken down, service members made 5% of the complaints, while Americans aged 62 or older made up roughly 10% of all complaints. That’s a high rate given just 35% of seniors who own a home have a mortgage[1].
[1] 2011 CFPB; Home borrowers in housing markets hardest hit by the mortgage crisis were more likely to contact the CFPB for aid in dealing with their home loans. Many of these are well known as places where home prices collapsed and foreclosures spiked during the last decade: Miami, Fort Myers, Fla., and Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., among them.
But complaint rates were high in expensive markets too. ZIP codes in San Francisco saw complaint rates of 0.73% of all mortgages held there – nearly twice the national rate (0.46%). Washington, D.C. zip codes had complaint rates of 1.29%, and three New York metro areas by ZIP code ranked among the top 10 nationwide: New Rochelle, Far Rockaway and New York City.
Note: we did not rank zip codes where there are fewer than 1,000 mortgages.; Three Digit Zip Code

1.14%; Since 2012, the first full year that the CFPB handled disputes, complaints for VA, FHA and reverse mortgages have seen some of the sharpest increases, more than doubling in the first four years between 2012 and 2016. That compares with a 10% increase for all mortgage complaints during the same period. :
VA mortgage disputes rose 187% to 1,421 from 495.
FHA mortgage disputes rose 102% to 5,478 from 2,707
Reverse mortgage disputes rose 172% to 562 from 206.
High dispute rates for these types of loans aren’t surprising. VA and FHA loans and reverse mortgages are most often to at risk and could benefit from a intermediary: veterans, low-income and older borrowers. These loans are also specialized products –that many lenders and servicers don’t have the expertise to handle, according to Erin Lantz, Trulia’s vice president for mortgages.; Year

9,164; Service members, which include active and reserve members of the military hold only 0.2% of the nation’s mortgages but have made 5% or 11,245, of all home loan complaints.
Likewise what the CFPB calls “older Americans,” made 10% of all complaints. By one measure, that’s fewer complaints than one would expect. Americans 62 years old or older hold 21.7% of all home loans. But for those just five years older that number falls to just over 10%.
In general, older Americans, are more likely to have paid off their home and be mortgage free than their younger home-owning counterparts. By the time most Americans turn 65, roughly 80% of own their own home and just 35.8% of them have a mortgage, according the U.S. Census Bureau. By contrast, 83.8% of those 45-54 years of age, who own a home have a mortgage.; Complaint data comes from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Data is from Dec. 1, 2011 through April 10, 2017. The CFPB defines “service member” as active-duty, Reserve and National Guard military members.
For the interactive map, we merged that data using 3-digit U.S. postal codes and mortgage data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 5-year American Community Survey for 2015."
david,What Locals Hate About New York City and San Francisco,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/311-nyc-sf/,2017-01-18,"New York and San Francisco are two of the nation’s most expensive big city housing markets. But pricey mortgages and steep rents aren’t the only burdens residents deal with. Each city has its own nuisances that drive locals crazy.
In short, New Yorkers could use some earplugs. They mostly complain about noise. Loud music and parties rank first, followed by banging, loud TVs and loud voices.
San Franciscans have sensitive eyes. They are more apt to be bothered by visual blight and are more likely to complain about graffiti, garbage and other visual nuisances.
Though each city logs its complaints differently, we were able to make a general comparison. We culled nearly a year’s worth of both cities’ 311 logs, the city-run information lines residents can, among other things, call to report nuisances.
Using that data, we’ve created maps for noise complaints in New York and reported eyesores in San Francisco. Each map is designed to provide both a bird’s eye view and a nuanced street view of 311 complaints over the last year — just change the zoom level or move around the map to adjust the view.
In New York:
Loud music and parties make up more than half of the 311 reports for noise in New York City.
The cacophony in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem neighborhoods led to the highest number of reports to 311.
In addition to noise, New Yorkers are more likely to complain when their building doesn’t have heat or hot water. They also get bent out of shape about blocked driveways and street conditions.; ; In San Francisco:
Graffiti mars the private and public surfaces in San Francisco, prompting most of the reports to 311. Thankfully, residents report that most of it is non-offensive.
The Mission, Chinatown and SoMa (South of Market) neighborhoods have the most graffiti complaints. The Mission had 10,675 complaints in 2016 – making up almost one out of every four complaints made in the city.
San Franciscans also are concerned about cleanliness. In addition to graffiti on their walls, they also tend to alert the city when their streets become a dumping ground for furniture, human waste, needles and other hazardous materials.
Homelessness is a problem in both New York and San Francisco, but the particular problem of illegal homeless encampments was among the top complaints in San Francisco: 5.8% of all complaints made by residents.; ; While many of the problems residents note in these complaints may seem to be part and parcel of city living, they do come at a time when living in New York or San Francisco is cost-prohibitive for many.
New York has the seventh highest median home price in the nation at $621,000 and 14th highest median rent at $2,322. San Francisco, of course, leads the nation with a median home price of $1.13 million and monthly median rents of $4,462, a 50.7% increase from five years ago.
 
Methodology
Data for this report comes from 311, which serves as a hotline for municipal non-emergency requests or complaints. These data are collected from public reports to the local 311 hotline, website form, or mobile application in New York City and San Francisco. Both New York City and San Francisco publish all 311 cases through their OpenData portals. 311 reports for New York City ranges from January 1, 2016 and December 16, 2016, and for San Francisco reports range from January 1, 2016 and December 18, 2016.
 
Data Aggregation
This report focuses on the top five categories of 311 cases for each city. For New York City, the main categories were drawn from “Complaint Type” and sub-categories were assigned from the “Descriptor.” For the San Francisco data, these categories were drawn from “Request Type” and sub-categories come from “Request Details.” To simplify the analysis, some categories were collapsed into one. San Francisco, for example, separates the Request Type for graffiti by whether it is found on public/private property and whether it is offensive or not, but we here lump these together. Sub-categories ensure that the broader complaints or requests do not mask the more granular types of grievances people report.
Note that neighborhoods identified in the analysis are based on Trulia’s proprietary neighborhood definitions.
 
Heat Maps
We plotted the raw, georeferenced data for the five most common types of complaints for each city. The more intense the color, the more frequently complaints occur in that area of the map. The heat maps animate over time and highlights areas where there are more complaints over others
A number of cases are reported without a specific location, in San Francisco 0.7% cases are missing actual locations and do not appear on the map but are counted in the larger discussion on the number of case types.  In New York, 1.7% of cases in the top five categories are missing location data."
david,No Debate: Swing State Housing Values Are Front-Runners,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/swing-state-home-values/,2016-09-26,"Battleground states have recorded stronger recoveries when it comes to home value, but does it mean they're more prosperous?; Achieving prosperity. That’s one of the three big topics to be discussed Monday night in Hempstead, N.Y., when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump square off in the first of three presidential debates.
Sounds simple, but how do we define prosperity?
For the candidates, it’s easy. They want to win over enough voters in swing states to capture the White House.
And for most Americans, buying a home is the biggest investment they will make in their lifetimes. So, it follows that most of us measure at least a part of our prosperity by the value of our homes.
So how have home values performed in battleground states?
The eight states identified as key to swinging this year’s presidential election – Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania — have seen home values rise more 30% since the end of 2011. That’s more than so-called red states (18%) that favor Republican candidates and blue states (29%) that consistently support Democratic candidates.
Among those battlegrounds, Nevada, (78%), Arizona, (53%), and Florida, (51%), have seen the sharpest increases during the last five years – a period that roughly coincides with the last presidential election and the bottom of the housing crash.; Median Home Value Change, Jan. 2012-July 2016

20; As always, the data comes with caveats. For instance, the dramatic value in home growth in Nevada is as much a result of inflated housing prices reached before the recession in 2008. Prices in that state had further to fall and their recovery to normalcy can look exaggerated when compared to a relatively stable state such as Ohio.
Monday’s debate, moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt, may go a long way toward determining which candidate voters believe will help the economy and, perhaps, push housing prices – and their own sense of prosperity – higher.
When asked in June what would likely happen to home prices if either Trump or Clinton were elected, 39% of Americans said prices would rise a little or a lot if Trump was elected compared to 29% for Clinton. Americans who identified as Independents also were more likely, 34% to 28%, to foresee rising housing prices under Trump than Clinton.
Something else to consider: both candidates have a record of drawing support from voters whose home values remain relatively flat. During the primary season both candidates performed better in counties where housing prices had risen only slightly since deepest part of the recession – when unemployment was at its highest level – the second quarter of 2009.
And finally, though blue states tend to have high housing values, it’s the swing states where housing prices have risen the most.
How will it all play out? The answer depends on how much pocketbook issues influence how the electorate votes. If it is, as former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville famously said, “the economy, stupid,” then swing state voters probably aren’t as upset with the status quo. After all, they’ve done pretty well.
If other issues such as foreign policy, health care, and immigration are more on voters minds then each candidate has his or her strengths.
Ultimately, we may never be sure of the answer even when the last candidate is standing on Nov. 9.; Median home value estimates come from internal data. Group home values are averages of individual state medians weighted by the number of housing units in each state based on the 2010 census."
david,Back to (Better) Schools: Most Improved School Districts in the U.S. Biggest Cities,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/better-schools/,2016-08-25,"Millennials rank schools among their highest priorities when it comes to finding a home. We’ve identified up-and-coming districts in the nation’s biggest metros.; For young families, finding quality public schools is a critical part of the home search process. When we surveyed millennials aged 18-34 in February about what was most important in a new home, they ranked quality schools just behind low crime and short commutes.
As our salute to the start of a new school year, we partnered with SchoolDigger.com to find school districts on the rise in each of the 10 biggest U.S. metros (we’ve also created a searchable database to find most-improved districts in the top 100 metros). We examined state test scores from the past five years to determine which districts are gaining on their peers in this area. Our list of big improvers stretches from the Cobble Hill neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY, to Acton-Agua, a small district in the northeast corner of metro Los Angeles.
This isn’t a ranking of the best schools. What we aimed to do was find school districts making big strides relative to their peers. We ranked metro-area schools against one another, identifying those making leaps in academic progress as measured by test scores.
School districts vary in size – some have just one school and only a few students – and that can skew the rankings. To avoid that pitfall, we eliminated districts with less than three schools and fewer than 1,000 students. For example, suburban Atlanta’s Social Circle City is compared with just 35 districts because that’s the number that met our size threshold.
Using SchoolDigger’s proprietary database of state test scores, we looked at how students in qualifying districts performed in 2011 and compared that with 2015 results. We added median home prices to give home seekers an idea of how much moving into one of these rising districts might cost.
Using test scores is just a starting point to make baseline comparisons on improving school districts, but test scores are not the only factor families use to determine the right school district for them.; Some highlights of our study:
Test scores in New York City Geographic District 15 in Brooklyn’s Cobble Hill neighborhood have skyrocketed to 59.1 from 22.8, putting it in the top half of qualifying New York metro districts. But Cobble Hill is expensive, with median home prices close to $2 million.
The Phoenix Elementary District saw test scores rise 28% in the past five years, but the district still ranks in the bottom half – 31st out of 50 qualifying districts in Phoenix.
In Blue Island, Il., on the south side of metro Chicago, District 218 consists of just four high schools. But the district now ranks 61st among qualifying districts, a big jump from 101st in 2011.
With 43 schools, Mansfield Independent School District in the Dallas metro is one of the biggest on our list of improvers. In 2015, it ranked 22nd among qualifying districts in the Dallas area, up from 47th four years earlier.; District

[2] Rank among metro districts by test score as measured by SchoolDigger.com
[3] Test score data from 2012; As our list shows, many of the school districts registering the biggest improvement are relatively small. A number of them, including Victor Valley Union High and Culpeper County Public Schools, are in the outer geographic extremes of their metros. For instance, Culpeper County, Va., is 70 miles from Washington.
In addition, although the districts have improved, in some cases the test scores are low relative to better performing districts in their metros. In other words, just because a district’s test scores have gotten better, it doesn’t mean its schools are top performers. In addition, the district may not be an option logistically for some home seekers because of distance or other reasons.
Although not many bigger-city districts made our most-improved list, plenty of them are moving up impressively in test-score rankings. New York City is chock full of districts where progress rivals Brooklyn’s District 15. In the Los Angeles metro, Antelope Valley and Pomona Unified have also improved dramatically.
To help you find the right district in your big metro, we’ve created a sortable database using SchoolDigger data along with our home price listing medians.; To come up with our rankings, we used school-level aggregated test score data from SchoolDigger.com. Here is more information about how SchoolDigger calculates a school’s Average Standard Score. Only schools that fell within the boundaries of the MSAs were included in the analysis, so even if a district has several locations outside the MSA borders, only schools in the MSA were considered. An average test score was calculated for each school district, weighted by the number of students enrolled in each district school. Districts with fewer than 3 schools in the MSA or fewer than 1,000 students were dropped before we ranked the districts for 2011 and 2015. The most-improved districts were those whose rankings had increased by the largest amount relative to other districts in the MSA. To determine median home prices for each district, we used internal Trulia listings data to look at median listing values in all zip codes containing schools within a given school district. We weighted these ZIP code prices by the number of students in each ZIP to determine a weighted average of median home prices for the district itself."
david,Hillary or Donald: Who’s Better For Housing?,Housing Policy,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/election-survey/,2016-07-07,"Trump has a 10-point lead on Clinton when Americans are asked about which candidate will spur higher home prices. Primary results also suggest candidates weren’t popular in places where housing prices had a strong recovery.; So of the two presumptive major-party nominees for U.S. presidency, whom do you think will be best for housing prices? The self-described successful real estate executive Donald Trump? Or the former U.S. Senator, first lady and U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton?
Americans appear to have more faith in Trump. When asked what would likely happen to home prices if either Trump or Clinton were elected, 39% of Americans said prices would rise a little or a lot if Trump was elected compared to 29% for Clinton, according to survey conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia. The survey was conducted from June 7-9, 2016, among 2,034 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. In addition:
Nearly half of Democrats, 47%, said housing prices would likely rise if Trump were elected, compared to just 24% of Democrats who said the same about Clinton.
Likewise, 38% of Republicans said home prices would rise if Clinton were elected, 33% said the same should Trump be elected.
Americans who identified as Independents also were more likely, 34% to 28% to foresee rising housing prices under Trump than Clinton. Forty-four percent of unmarried respondents and 46% or renters also saw higher housing prices under Trump, compared to 26% of unmarried respondents and 26% of renters for Clinton.
Millennials and younger voters, aged 18-34, were more likely to believe housing prices would rise under Trump vs. Clinton, by a margin of 49% to 26%.; Q. If each of the following presidential candididates is elected president in November, what do you think will happen to home prices?

13%; The results stand in contrast to a Zillow survey of more than 100 economists and real estate experts. That report, which was published May 17 and included other candidates who had not yet dropped out of the race, found that Clinton would have the most positive net effect on the housing market – though it did not distinguish if that would mean higher or lower housing prices.
Ralph McLaughlin, Trulia’s chief economist, notes that Americans probably don’t have much information about either candidates’ positions on the U.S. housing market.
“Voters shouldn’t necessarily be surprised by the little attention that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have paid to housing this election cycle,” McLaughlin said. “Eight years ago, housing and the economy were the main talking points of Obama and McCain because millions of homeowners were going through foreclosure and the economy was in shambles.
“Today, the housing market and US economy look much healthier, and as such, candidates have turned their attention to more popular issues such as immigration, gun control, and national security.”
McLaughlin added that there has been some position-taking on housing. A big chunk, $25 billion of her proposed $125 billion Economic Revitalization Initiative, is targeted towards facilitating homeownership among households that have been traditionally underserved.
Trump has spoken about eliminating the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development – the primary federal source of funding for affordable housing, McLaughlin said.
We also asked Americans if they would make any housing decisions based on the election of either candidate:; Clinton

78%; Americans gave an overall edge to Trump in our poll when it came to a strong (higher-priced) housing market. During the primary season, however, both candidates performed better in counties where housing prices had risen only slightly since deepest part of the recession – when unemployment was at its highest level – the second quarter of 2009. For instance:
In counties that Clinton won during primary season, combined housing prices rose 3.1%. In counties she lost, almost all to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, prices rose 7.1%.
Likewise, Trump won counties that saw combined housing price appreciation of 4.2%. He lost counties that had a combined price increase of 6.6%.
Trump tended to lose in counties where employment, or job growth, was strong in the recovery.

david,What Brexit Means for the U.S. Housing Market,Home Buying and Selling,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/brexit-ushousing/,2016-06-24,"Britain's decision to leave the European Union shouldn't affect home buying and selling in the short term – but keep an eye on the global economy.; Britain’s decision to leave the European Union is roiling global markets. But what, if anything, does it mean for the U.S. housing market?
The answer is no one really knows, and that’s the problem.
Simply put, the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, or “Brexit,” is a global macro-economic event that will, over time, have smaller but not necessarily insignificant, economic impact here. Collectively the EU, at nearly $700 billion annually, is our biggest trading partner. Britain alone, at more than $100 billion annually, is the seventh-biggest. The EU is the world’s biggest economy. Should it stumble badly, trading partners would also take a fall.
In the short term, for the U.S. housing market, the most direct threat isn’t from trade. It’s about the financial system and banking. Every housing market, including the United States’, is sensitive to interest rates. How central banks, such as the Federal Reserve respond to the Brexit fallout –by keeping rates low, for instance – would constitute impact.
Today, as Trulia Chief Economist Ralph McLaughlin points out, U.S. debt is viewed as a source of security for global investors. As nervous investors rush into the safety of U.S. securities, it puts downward pressure on rates. That means borrowing will be cheaper for buyers in the immediate Brexit wake.
“While the departure of the UK from the European Union has driven down the 10-year bond, and thus mortgage rates, we expect them to rebound later in the year as uncertainty over the economic consequences of the departure lifts,” McLaughlin said.
Those “economic consequences” may indeed be manageable. Or, they could be dramatic. Some have predicted the Brexit will lead to the dissolution of the EU. That scenario likely would trigger an economic recession in Britain and/or the EU. It’s not a stretch to think an EU collapse could spur a global slowdown — even a crisis. The U.S. economy is slowly, steadily growing. But a global recession that hammers U.S. exports could drag us down with it. That’s just one scenario. Again, no one really knows.
McLaughlin said that even if the global economic conditions do not deteriorate into recession territory, investors buying U.S. currency could also have an impact.
“As the U.S. dollar rises against other currencies, goods made in the U.S. for export look increasingly expensive,” he said. “Given recent slow domestic GDP growth, a decrease in trade could slow the domestic economy even further.”
The bottom line is, while potentially damaging, none of this should alter home-buying or selling decisions today. After all, as McLaughlin said, the immediate impact is essentially cheaper money.
And even while lower rates may save borrowers a little money each month, as Erin Lantz, Zillow’s vice president for mortgages said, “if you couldn’t afford a house a few weeks ago, you still can’t.”
But as the not-to-distant past reminds us, a recession brings lower income and higher unemployment and that puts a housing market at risk. Anyone considering a housing move should keep an eye on the news out of Europe and its effect on U.S. growth.
The uncertainty of Brexit should mean vigilance for U.S. home buyers and sellers."
david,Americans Don’t Fear Rising Interest Rates – They Fear They Won’t Find A Home,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/interest-rate-survey-2016/,2016-06-14,"Decisions made at this week's Fed meeting could make borrowing for a home more expensive, but Americans – especially millennials – are less likely to be worried about rising interest rates than they are about finding a home they like.; On the eve of a pivotal Fed meeting that could shift mortgage interest rates, more Americans worry they won’t be able to find a home or that they couldn’t get a mortgage than worry about rates rising.
Nearly a third, 30%, worry that they won’t be able to find a home for sale that they like if they were to buy a home this year, according to a survey conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia from June 7-9, 2016, among 2,034 U.S. adults ages 18 and older.
Only 20% said they worried mortgage rates would rise before they bought.
Fears of finding a home appear to be growing for younger adults. Millennials, between the ages of 18 to 34 years old, were more likely to say they were worried about finding a home than other age groups: 37% said they worried they couldn’t find a home they liked – that’s up from 30% in our survey in September 2015.
“Consumers are increasingly worried about tight inventory when finding a home, and rightly so,” said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Trulia. “Low inventory has been, and will continue to be, a strong headwind for house hunters, and impacts their ability to buy a home much more than increases in mortgage rates.”
Among other findings, Trulia said in its last quarterly inventory report that during the last four years the number of starter homes on the market dropped by 43.6% and the number of trade-up homes on the market decreased by 41%.
“Homebuyers should be more worried about finding a home than interest rates. In most markets, mortgage rates rates would have to be between 7% to 10% for financial advantages of homeownership to fall away.” Read more Trulia research about renting vs. buying.; Answer

17%; Though finding a home may be the primary concern for potential buyers, they do have some guesses about where interest rates will go. A solid 40% of Americans think interest rates will change in the next six months. The vast majority, 37% overall, say rates will go higher. Another 24% say rates will stay the same. Just 2% overall expect rates to go lower.

37%; As you might expect, the higher the rates might go, the more Americans would be discouraged from buying a home. Even a small increase, such as the Fed spur rates on a 30-year mortgage to 5%, could impact home purchasing. 19% of Americans say they’d be discouraged if the mortgage rates rose to 5% and at 6%, another 19% would be discouraged.
Add that to the 28% who would say they will never buy a home (13%) or already feel mortgage rates are too high at 4% for them to consider buying a home (15%), we’d see a lot of hesitation. And should rates rise to 7%, 61% of Americans say they would be discouraged from buying a home.
Now consider that between 1971 and 2001 interest rates were at least 7% and for many years above 10% — from 1979 to 1991 for instance. In fact, “historically low” interest rates used to mean rates of around 6%.; Over the last year, mortgage interest rates have stayed steady between 3.5% and 4.0%. How high would rates have to rise to discourage you from buying your first or next home?

14%; When the Fed decides to raise rates, as it did in December, the increase is almost always nominal and subsequent hikes gradual.
If rates increase 25 basis points, mortgage rates are still at historical lows and exceptionally favorable for homebuyers. The actual impact on a typical homebuyer will be marginal, but this really depends on the buyer’s budget, according to Trulia research. A survey conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Trulia from September 14 -16, 2015 among 2,031 U.S. adults 18 and older, 69% of Americans who would ever buy a home said $250,000 or less is the maximum price that they would be willing to pay to buy their first or next home.
So for a buyer with household income of $60,000 and 20% down payment, the increase in mortgage rates on a 30-year fixed rate loan from 3.75% to 4.00%, would mean that the maximum amount they could spend on a home would fall from about $308,000 to $301,000 – keeping within the budget of most Americans. The drop is relatively larger for a buyer with household income of $100,000, but their budget is also relatively larger.  Long story short, an increase in rates would not turn people off from buying a home, but it may slightly lower the price range in which they are looking to buy. Also, the impact is quite dependent on the price range in which the prospective buyer is looking to buy.; Maximum Home Price for which Median Household Income Can Qualify

david,There’s No Crying About Home Values In Baseball,Livability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/baseball-stadiums-2016/,2016-03-30,"Take me out to the ball game? If it’s in your backyard, and the stadium is new, chances are you own an expensive home for your market, or you’re paying more rent.; The neighborhoods around major league baseball stadiums tend to have higher home values than the greater metro areas surrounding them, but those values vary widely based on stadium location.
Having a major league baseball team as a next-door neighbor requires a special kind of host. More than 73.7 million people attended regular season games last year, an average of 30,366 a game.
We took a look at homes within a mile of U.S. MLB parks (we excluded Toronto) to gauge how well baseball had made itself at home. We found that the areas around 18 of the 29 stadiums had higher median home values compared to the cities in which they resided. We also found that rents in those 18 neighborhoods were either higher or equal to those in the surrounding towns.
Newer stadiums also tend to be located in pricier neighborhoods. Of the 14 stadiums built since 1999, only two neighborhoods – around Marlins Park in Miami and Miller Park in Milwaukee – had home values lower than the metros in which they were located. Rents were higher in those neighborhoods too, except for those around Miller and Marlins parks.
When it came to older stadiums home values were more split. Of the 11 stadiums built in, or before, 1999, six had home values and rents at or above the median market rate.
Overall, the areas around MLB stadiums had home values 15% higher than the greater metros in which they were located. Rents varied widely, but taken as a whole were roughly in line with local markets.
The Kansas City Royals, the reigning World Series champions, may be the kings when it comes to the game, but the neighborhood around Kauffman Stadium is affordable for paupers. It ranks among the least expensive for rents, 52.4% lower, and home values, 51.6% lower, relative to the Kansas City metro area.
Bronx Bombers: Yankee Stadium’s close proximity to the tony Upper East Side helped its neighborhood home values rank 81.7% higher than the New York City metro area.
The neighborhoods around O.co Coliseum, the home of the Oakland Athletics, are among the least expensive in the East Bay, while rents and home values near AT&T Park in San Francisco are roughly in line with the rest of the Bay Area. It’s also the most expensive neighborhood to live within walking distance of an MLB park.
Old time baseball: Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, the oldest major league ballparks respectively, are premium destinations for renters and home buyers. Both ranked in the top 10 with rents and home values above the medians for their cities, Boston and Chicago,
Top of the Order: Where Home Values Are Higher
Urban or downtown stadiums tend to have higher values than surrounding metro areas. Newer stadiums including Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia and Nationals Park in Washington made the top 10, but older stadiums with thriving neighborhoods such as Kenmore Square and Back Bay Fens around Fenway Park in Boston and Wrigleyville in Chicago also carried higher values as measured by home values.

Bottom of the order: Older Stadiums and Unfriendly Locations
Home values tended to be lower around stadiums that were built more than 20 years ago – six of the bottom 10 were built before 1996 — including Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., and O.co Stadium in Oakland, Calif. Other lower home values were found around stadiums in industrial areas or, in the case of Miller Park in Milwaukee, a lot of traffic from interstate highways.

Stealing Home: Where Rents Are Cheaper Near MLB Parks
Not surprisingly, it was cheaper to rent near stadiums where home values were lower. Rentals in Kansas City, Oakland, Calif., and Milwaukee were at least 20% below the greater market rate. Surprisingly, newer or renowned stadiums such as Marlins Park in Miami, built in 2012 and Baltimore’s Camden Yards, which became a model for parks built after 1992, were surrounded by neighborhoods with relatively lower rents.

Juiced Rents: Where It Costs More to Rent Near A Ballpark
Not all of the places where ballpark home values were low had lower rents. In Cleveland, for instance, rents were 16.7% higher than the greater market, but home values were just 9.2% higher. Conversely, Detroit rents are 11.8% higher near Comerica Park, but home values are a whopping 48.4% higher than Detroit metro.

If you love the game, the cheapest places to live close to a major league team are in the Midwest. Newer stadiums and very, very old stadiums such as Wrigley and Fenway carry a premium to their local markets.
Methodology
To determine whether homes near MLB stadiums are worth more or less than other homes in a metro area, we did a simple comparison of the median home value within a one-mile radius of an MLB stadium on March 1, 2016, to the median home value of homes in the metropolitan outside the 1-mile radius."
david,Why It’s Better To Live In A Super Tuesday State,Affordability,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/super-tuesday/,2016-02-25,"The 12 Super Tuesday states will have a big say in who the next president is. Are they better off than they were four, five or even 10 years ago? How about when they’re compared to the rest of the nation?; Due to a data calculation error, this post has been updated to reflect the following changes: the wage increase for individuals in Super Tuesday states between Q4 2011 and Q2 2015 is 8.9%. The change during the same period for non-Super Tuesday states is 8%. Individual income, measured as a weighted four-quarter rolling average, for workers in Super Tuesday states was $52,026 as of June 30, 2015 and $52,000 for non-voting states and D.C.
On March 1, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Vermont will be holding primaries, while Alaska, Colorado and Minnesota will be holding party caucuses. Because of the sheer size and geographic diversity of these states, the collection of 12 primaries and caucuses that are held on the first Tuesday in March is considered the broadest and most representative of all primary season contest dates.
More than half – 632 of 1,237 — of the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination and nearly half — 1,007 of 2,383 — of the Democratic delegates needed to win the nomination will be up for grabs that day. How these voters have fared economically under President Obama may have an impact on how they vote.
Looking at some key measures, we wanted to see if these Super Tuesday states are better off than they were four years ago, especially in the realm of home ownership, and how these states compared to the rest of the nation. Turns out, if you live in a Super Tuesday state, chances are that when it comes to housing and your ability to afford it; you are.
Super Tuesday states were less affected by the housing crisis when measuring monthly foreclosure sales rates. The states voting March 1 saw roughly half as many foreclosure sales – as a percentage of all sales – between 2008 and 2012 than non-voting states.
The median listed home price in Super Tuesday states has risen 50.1%, during the last four years and now is worth 7.7% more than the median home in non-voting states – the Super Tuesday median home was worth 2.8% less in 2011.
Some Super Tuesday states lag the nation when it comes to a housing recovery. The median home price in Vermont has slipped 0.4% in the last five years. Median home prices in Alabama, up 7.1% and Arkansas, up 8.4%, fall below the double-digit gains seen nationally among all Super Tuesday states. But some Super Tuesday states have seen a dramatic housing recovery. The median house price in Texas is up 50.1% in the last five years and up 39.9% in Colorado.
We also found Super Tuesday states were more stable when it came to creating jobs, saw better wage growth and when it came to home prices, saw a recovery that valued the median Super Tuesday home at a higher level than the rest of the country.
States voting March 1 also were more likely to add jobs in the recovery and less likely to lose them in the recession. Super Tuesday states added 2.88 million jobs during the last decade, an increase of 8.7%. The other 38 states and District of Columbia added 2.96 million jobs, just a 3% increase.
Wages in Super Tuesday states are growing at a faster rate. The average Super Tuesday individual made roughly the same as workers in non-Super Tuesday states did last year, but have seen a nearly 2.5 percentage-point swing from 10 years ago.
No surprise then that population in Super Tuesday states is growing faster than the rest of the nation. Those states have 83.5 million residents, 25.9% of the nation’s population and have added 5.6% to their combined total since 2010, compared to 3.3% growth in the other 38 states and District of Columbia.
So as candidates from across the political spectrum fan out to make their last-minute appeals, they may want to consider that while Super Tuesday states are a big slice of America, they’re also doing a little bit better than the rest of the nation.
Housing Prices and the Foreclosures
Since 2008, Super Tuesday states have had fewer foreclosures than their non-voting counterparts. The one exception: Colorado where foreclosure sales as a percentage of all sales was above 20% for 21 months and peaked at 24.1% of all sales the third quarter of 2008. By contrast, the percentage of foreclosure sales during roughly the same time was 9.8% to 12.1% for Super Tuesday states and 14.7% to 17.7%for non-Super Tuesday states.

Four of the 12 states helped Super Tuesday states beat out the rest of the nation when it came to median listing prices, our measure of home prices. Massachusetts ($374,000), Colorado ($362,110), Virginia ($297,995) and Texas ($270,000) all had median listing prices in 2015 that beat the rest of the nation’s median: $249,250. Price surges in those states – especially Colorado where listing prices rose 39.8% from 2011 to 2015 – helped Super Tuesday collectively beat the rest of the country with an average median premium of 7.7% to the rest of the country.

Jobs and Wages
Individual income, measured as a weighted four-quarter rolling average, for workers in Super Tuesday states was $52,026, as of June 30, 2015. That’s roughly even with the $52,000 average in other states and D.C. Wages in Super Tuesday states have been rising at a faster rate than the rest of the nation since 2007. Massachusetts leads Super Tuesday states with an average income of $65,390.

During the last decade, this year’s Super Tuesday states added jobs at a greater rate, 8.7%, than non-voting states, 3%, before the recession and after. They were also better at keeping jobs during the recession. At no point between 2006 and 2015 did the 38 other states show better job growth than Super Tuesday states.
So, what does this mean when March 1 results are tallied? Ultimately, Super Tuesday results generally come from states that have generally stronger economies and housing markets than the rest of the nation. Issues such as immigration’s effect on wages and jobs, income inequality and other pocketbook issues may not resonate as deeply in states where the economy is generally stronger than the rest of the country.

Methodology
Employment and wage statistics from 2006 to 2015 were provided by the most recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report. We used a four-quarter rolling average of average quarterly employment and four-quarter rolling average of wages (weighted by employment) to adjust for seasonality. We grouped Super Tuesday states and states not voting March 1 separately.
To determine home prices, we used Trulia listing prices excluding foreclosures. Findings are based on median listing prices for each state and the median of all listings in Super Tuesday states vs. the 38 other states including the District of Columbia.
Foreclosure information is weighted by the number of sales and based off of an internal public records database of home sales. In addition to excluding non-disclosure sates, Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and South Dakota were also excluded due to quality issues.
Non-disclosure states include: Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri (some counties), Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.
Population information came from the U.S. Census Bureau latest population estimates."
david,Field Position: Does An NFL Stadium Boost Your Home Value?,Home Amenities,https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/nfl-stadium/,2016-01-20,"Pro football’s return to Los Angeles hinges on a new stadium project that promises to enhance the economy and property values of the region.; Call it a different kind of “red zone.” Neighborhoods around National Football League stadiums tend to have homes that are more expensive both in sales and rental value, but new stadiums built in the last decade, by and large, have failed to lift the fortunes of homes in nearby areas.
In other words, owning a home near a stadium is nice, but if they build one down the street, don’t get your hopes up.
The impact of NFL stadiums on surrounding areas is a timely issue given that the Super Bowl will be played Feb. 7 in the new Levi’s Stadium – a venue sought after in the Bay Area and eventually built in Santa Clara, Calif., – and the protracted fight over the league’s return to Los Angeles after a 20-year absence. Last week, NFL owners voted 30-2 to return the Rams franchise to the Los Angeles area, specifically, a site in Inglewood, Calif.
Trulia took a look at the current value of real estate and comparable rentals within a 2-mile radius around existing NFL stadiums, evaluated changes to home values near stadiums built in the last decade, and examined the areas around the proposed new sites in Los Angeles. We excluded the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., since it just opened in 2014, and omitted the temporary home of the Minnesota Vikings while including its future home, US Bank Stadium. While we did not find a definitive cause-and-effect between stadiums and home values, there were some strong relationships. We found:
Of the 31 neighborhoods around the nation’s pro football stadiums, nearly two thirds have higher housing values, on average, than houses in non-stadium neighborhoods.
Inglewood, Calif., the planned new home for the Rams has home values that lag the region by 8.9%. A proposed site in Carson, Calif., has slightly higher home values, on average (1.8%), than other homes in the Los Angeles market.
The neighborhood surrounding the former Rams’ home, the Edward Jones Dome, potentially has a lot to lose: homes within two miles of the dome are worth 16.7% more than homes in the St. Louis area on average.
During the last 10 years, five new pro football stadiums have opened and none, so far, has had a noticeable impact in raising home values in its immediate vicinity (a two mile radius).
Near Dallas, prices around AT&T stadium have lost value compared to the greater Arlington, Texas, area since that venue opened in 2009.
Prices of homes near Lucas Oil Stadium have failed to keep pace with the greater Indianapolis market since the venue opened in August 2008.

City officials in St. Louis, citing the value of the franchise to the community, offered more than $400 million in taxpayer money to build a new $1.1 billion stadium and keep the team. Inglewood officials are also offering tax breaks for a $2.2 billion project that may include new residential construction. Home values and rents near the Edward Jones Dome are 16.7% and 5.1% higher, respectively, than homes in the St. Louis metro area on average, according to our study.; 33

-8.7%; Though every stadium has its own unique characteristics – MetLife Stadium, for instance, is located in the sparsely populated Meadowlands region of East Rutherford, N.J., while Heinz Field is in downtown Pittsburgh – studies have shown that these structures have a significant economic impact on their neighbors including residential real estate.
What our research, like other previous studies, suggests is that the impact, if any, is inconclusive and/or the neighborhood surrounding the stadium, rather than the stadium itself, is the determining factor.
For instance, buyers and renters pay a premium to live near some stadiums including Lincoln Field, home to the Philadelphia Eagles, and First Energy Stadium, home the Cleveland Browns. A buyer should expect to pay 44.3% more than they would for an average Philly home, or 31.2% more for an average Cleveland home. Likewise, rents are 8.9% and 12.9% higher respectively.
Contrast those premiums with home values and rents near CenturyLink Field, where the Seattle Seahawks play and Heinz Field where the Pittsburgh Steelers play. Homes are 14.7% less and rents 8.7% lower within a couple miles of the Seattle stadium, home values 18.0% less and rents 5.9% less near Heinz Field than comparable homes in those cities.
Inglewood Pitched As More Than A Stadium
Rams owner Stan Kroenke has pitched the Inglewood stadium as more than just a football venue. The site will be developed with movie theaters, shopping and with a residential component. It will also house league offices and play host to TV and digital production for the NFL.
“We think it’s going to boost property values,” said Sandra Green-Murray, a real estate agent with Playa Marina Properties in Los Angeles. “This is an area with a lot of property that can be developed. We’re expecting lots of growth.”
Green-Murray said Inglewood has been a hot market as of late. Inventory is low and homes don’t stay on the market long. Inglewood still lags greater LA for average home prices.
Methodology
To determine whether homes near NFL stadiums are worth more or less than other homes in a metro area, we estimated a hedonic model to determine the effect of being within two miles of a stadium on a home’s value while controlling for the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square feet, lot size, age, and zip code of each property. This allowed us to estimate the percentage value difference for properties near stadiums compared to properties further away. We used a 10% level for statistical significance, and employed a 5% trimmed sample to reduce the effects of outliers on the regression estimates. Only metros where the coefficient on being within two miles from a stadium was significant were considered as having an effect. Among the 31 U.S. metros with NFL teams that we examined (the Giants and Jets share a stadium in New Jersey), all but one made the cut. Also, we excluded Levi Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., since it just opened in 2015."
